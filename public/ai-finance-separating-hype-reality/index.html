Finance: Separating Hype from Reality This is the first installment in my series “Financial Leadership in the AI Era.” If you’re new here, check out the introduction post to learn what this series is all about.\nThe Current State of AI in Finance Departments Three weeks into my new role as a finance manager, I’ve been cataloging every vendor pitch that mentions AI, machine learning, or automation. The result? A spreadsheet with 23 different solutions, all promising to revolutionize our finance function through the power of artificial intelligence.\nBut when I dig deeper into these offerings, a familiar pattern emerges: what’s marketed as “AI” often spans a spectrum from simple rules-based automation to genuine machine learning applications. This disconnect between marketing and reality isn’t unique to my experience.\nAccording to Gartner’s 2024 research, while 84% of finance organizations report implementing or planning to implement AI technologies, only 27% report achieving significant business outcomes from these implementations (Gartner, 2024). This gap between adoption and realized value suggests many finance teams are struggling to separate AI hype from reality.\nCommon Misconceptions About AI Capabilities in Finance Before we can effectively implement AI in finance, we need to clear up some persistent misconceptions:\nMisconception #1: AI will replace finance professionals Reality: The evidence suggests otherwise. A 2023 study by Deloitte found that organizations successfully implementing AI in finance experienced a shift in roles rather than elimination—with 67% of finance professionals spending more time on analysis and decision support after AI implementation, compared to 31% before (Deloitte, 2023).\nIn my conversations with other finance leaders, the consensus is clear: AI excels at processing transactions, identifying patterns, and generating insights, but human judgment remains essential for strategic decision-making and stakeholder communication.\nMisconception #2: AI implementation is primarily a technology challenge Reality: In my own department’s experimentation with AP automation, I’ve found that technical integration represents only about 30% of the implementation challenge. The remaining 70% involves process redesign, change management, and data governance.\nThis matches findings from McKinsey, which reports that successful AI implementations in finance dedicate 40-50% of project resources to organizational change management (McKinsey, 2024).\nMisconception #3: AI solutions work effectively out of the box Reality: Even the most advanced AI systems require significant training and customization to deliver value in finance. A 2023 survey by the Association of Finance Professionals found that finance departments spent an average of 6-9 months training and refining AI systems before achieving reliable performance (AFP, 2023).\nWhat AI Can and Cannot Do Today in Finance To make informed decisions about AI implementation, finance leaders need a realistic understanding of current capabilities:\nWhat AI Can Do Today: Automate routine transaction processing: AI-powered systems can effectively automate up to 80% of accounts payable and receivable processes, according to research from Ardent Partners (2023).\nEnhance fraud detection: Machine learning models can identify unusual patterns that might indicate fraud with greater accuracy than rule-based systems. JP Morgan’s COiN platform reportedly reviews documents in seconds that would take 360,000 hours manually (JP Morgan, 2023).\nImprove forecasting accuracy: In a controlled study by the International Institute of Forecasters, machine learning forecasting models reduced error rates by 15-30% compared to traditional methods for certain financial metrics (IIF, 2024).\nStreamline document processing: Natural language processing can extract key information from unstructured documents with 85-95% accuracy, dramatically reducing manual review time (ACCA Global, 2023).\nWhat AI Cannot (Yet) Reliably Do: Make strategic financial decisions: While AI can provide decision support, it cannot replace human judgment in complex, high-stakes financial decisions.\nAdapt quickly to major economic shifts: Most AI models struggle when economic conditions change dramatically from their training data.\nExplain its reasoning fully: Despite advances in explainable AI, many financial machine learning models remain “black boxes,” creating challenges for governance and compliance.\nManage stakeholder relationships: The human elements of finance—building trust, negotiating, and communicating difficult messages—remain beyond AI’s capabilities.\nCase Studies: Success vs. Hype Success Story: Progressive Automation at Unilever Unilever’s finance function demonstrates what realistic, value-driven AI implementation looks like. Rather than pursuing a comprehensive “finance transformation,” Unilever implemented targeted AI solutions in accounts payable, forecasting, and financial controls.\nTheir approach focused on specific pain points, with each implementation following a consistent pattern:\nStart with a narrow use case Measure baseline performance Run controlled pilots Scale gradually with continuous measurement After three years of this targeted approach, Unilever reported a 40% reduction in manual transactions and a 20% improvement in forecasting accuracy (Unilever Annual Report, 2023).\nHype Example: The “AI Financial Transformation” That Wasn’t In contrast, a Fortune 500 company (unnamed in the Harvard Business Review case study) invested $15 million in a comprehensive AI-powered finance transformation. Two years later, the project was scaled back after delivering only marginal improvements.\nThe post-mortem analysis identified several cautionary lessons:\nThe project attempted to simultaneously transform too many finance processes Baseline metrics were not established before implementation The solution relied heavily on “perfect” data that didn’t exist in the organization The team overestimated the AI’s ability to handle exceptions and edge cases (Harvard Business Review, 2023) A Framework for Evaluating AI Claims from Vendors Based on my research and early experiences evaluating AI solutions, I’ve developed a preliminary framework for assessing vendor claims:\nThe 5-Question AI Reality Check Can you explain exactly how your AI works in non-technical terms?\nRed flag: Vague explanations that rely heavily on buzzwords\nWhat specific data does your solution require, and what is the minimum quality threshold?\nRed flag: Claims that the solution works with “any data” regardless of quality\nWhat percentage of the process will still require human intervention?\nRed flag: Promises of 100% automation or unclear answers\nCan you provide before-and-after metrics from similar implementations?\nRed flag: Case studies without specific, measurable outcomes\nWhat’s your approach to exceptions and edge cases?\nRed flag: Dismissing edge cases as “rare” or “not significant”\nIn applying this framework at my company, we’ve already eliminated three potential “AI” solutions that, upon closer examination, offered little beyond basic automation rebranded as artificial intelligence.\nPractical First Steps for Finance Leaders If you’re a finance leader beginning your AI journey, here are some practical steps based on my experience and research:\nAudit your current processes to identify pain points where AI might add value, focusing on high-volume, rule-based activities with clean data.\nStart small with a pilot in a non-critical process area, establishing clear success metrics before beginning.\nInvest in data quality as a foundation for any AI implementation. According to IBM, organizations spend 40-60% of their AI project time on data preparation (IBM, 2023).\nBuild internal knowledge by identifying team members with aptitude and interest in AI, and supporting their learning and experimentation.\nCreate an AI evaluation committee with representatives from finance, IT, and business units to assess potential solutions.\nMy Learning So Far Three weeks into exploring AI for our finance function, my biggest realization is that effective implementation isn’t primarily about technology—it’s about clearly defining problems worth solving. The finance teams seeing the most success aren’t those with the most advanced AI, but those who have identified specific, measurable process pain points where AI can deliver tangible value.\nIn my next post, I’ll explore “Building Your Finance Team’s AI Literacy,” sharing the curriculum I’m developing to help my team understand and engage with AI opportunities. I’ll cover essential concepts every finance professional should understand, practical training approaches, and how to assess your team’s current AI readiness.\nYour Turn I’d love to hear about your experiences with AI in finance:\nWhat AI solutions have you implemented or evaluated in your finance function? Which claims from vendors have you found to be exaggerated? What criteria do you use to separate genuine AI value from hype?

Two years later, the project was scaled back after delivering only marginal improvements.</p><p>The post-mortem analysis identified several cautionary lessons:</p><ul><li>The project attempted to simultaneously transform too many finance processes</li><li>Baseline metrics were not established before implementation</li><li>The solution relied heavily on &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; data that didn&rsquo;t exist in the organization</li><li>The team overestimated the AI&rsquo;s ability to handle exceptions and edge cases (Harvard Business Review, 2023)</li></ul><h2 id=a-framework-for-evaluating-ai-claims-from-vendors>A Framework for Evaluating AI Claims from Vendors<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#a-framework-for-evaluating-ai-claims-from-vendors>#</a></h2><p>Based on my research and early experiences evaluating AI solutions, I&rsquo;ve developed a preliminary framework for assessing vendor claims:</p><h3 id=the-5-question-ai-reality-check>The 5-Question AI Reality Check<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-5-question-ai-reality-check>#</a></h3><ol><li><p><strong>Can you explain exactly how your AI works in non-technical terms?</strong><br><em>Red flag: Vague explanations that rely heavily on buzzwords</em></p></li><li><p><strong>What specific data does your solution require, and what is the minimum quality threshold?</strong><br><em>Red flag: Claims that the solution works with &ldquo;any data&rdquo; regardless of quality</em></p></li><li><p><strong>What percentage of the process will still require human intervention?</strong><br><em>Red flag: Promises of 100% automation or unclear answers</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Can you provide before-and-after metrics from similar implementations?</strong><br><em>Red flag: Case studies without specific, measurable outcomes</em></p></li><li><p><strong>What&rsquo;s your approach to exceptions and edge cases?</strong><br><em>Red flag: Dismissing edge cases as &ldquo;rare&rdquo; or &ldquo;not significant&rdquo;</em></p></li></ol><p>In applying this framework at my company, we&rsquo;ve already eliminated three potential &ldquo;AI&rdquo; solutions that, upon closer examination, offered little beyond basic automation rebranded as artificial intelligence.</p><h2 id=practical-first-steps-for-finance-leaders>Practical First Steps for Finance Leaders<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#practical-first-steps-for-finance-leaders>#</a></h2><p>If you&rsquo;re a finance leader beginning your AI journey, here are some practical steps based on my experience and research:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Audit your current processes</strong> to identify pain points where AI might add value, focusing on high-volume, rule-based activities with clean data.</p></li><li><p><strong>Start small with a pilot</strong> in a non-critical process area, establishing clear success metrics before beginning.</p></li><li><p><strong>Invest in data quality</strong> as a foundation for any AI implementation.

The finance teams seeing the most success aren&rsquo;t those with the most advanced AI, but those who have identified specific, measurable process pain points where AI can deliver tangible value.</p><p>In my next post, I&rsquo;ll explore &ldquo;Building Your Finance Team&rsquo;s AI Literacy,&rdquo; sharing the curriculum I&rsquo;m developing to help my team understand and engage with AI opportunities.
