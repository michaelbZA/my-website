Whether you\u0026rsquo;re building financial models, automating reporting, or creating data analysis tools, there comes a point when your code needs to be shared with colleagues or even the wider finance community. This post will guide you through best practices for creating high-quality, shareable code.\nVersion Control: Git \u0026amp; GitHub for Financial Projects Why Version Control Matters in Finance Imagine you\u0026rsquo;ve built a Python script that calculates key financial ratios from quarterly reports.

You can share the link with colleagues, collaborate on improvements, and track issues.\nPull Requests: The Professional Way to Collaborate When working with a team of financial analysts, direct changes to the main codebase can be risky. Pull requests (PRs) provide a mechanism for review and discussion before code is merged:\nMake your changes in a separate branch Push that branch to GitHub Open a PR to merge your branch into main Have teammates review your code Merge the PR once approved This workflow is perfect for finance teams where code accuracy is critical; catching calculation errors before they make it into production reports!\nWriting Clean, PEP 8 Compliant Code What is PEP 8? PEP 8 is Python\u0026rsquo;s style guide—a set of conventions for writing readable code. In finance, where you might be sharing models with auditors or other stakeholders, clean code is particularly important.\nKey PEP 8 Rules for Finance Code Use 4 spaces for indentation (not tabs) Keep lines under 79 characters for better readability in documentation Use descriptive variable names that reflect financial concepts: # Bad def calc(a, b): return a / b # Good def calculate_price_to_earnings_ratio(stock_price, earnings_per_share): return stock_price / earnings_per_share Use whitespace appropriately: # Bad profit=revenue-expenses tax_amount=profit*tax_rate # Good profit = revenue - expenses tax_amount = profit * tax_rate Using Linters: flake8 Linters automatically check your code for style issues. Let\u0026rsquo;s set up flake8:\nInstall flake8: pip install flake8 Run flake8 on your code: flake8 ratio_calculator.py It will show any style violations that need fixing.\nFor a real finance project, create a configuration file (.flake8) in your project root: [flake8]\rmax-line-length = 88\rexclude = .git,__pycache__,build,dist\rper-file-ignores =\r__init__.py: F401 Auto-formatting with black Why spend time manually formatting code when tools can do it for you?\nInstall black: pip install black Format your code: black ratio_calculator.py Black will automatically reformat your code to follow a consistent style.\nFor finance projects, you might want to create a pyproject.toml file to configure black: [tool.black] line-length = 88 target-version = [\u0026#39;py38\u0026#39;] include = \u0026#39;\\.pyi?$\u0026#39; exclude = \u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u0026#39; /( \\.git | \\.hg | \\.mypy_cache | \\.tox | \\.venv | _build | buck-out | build | dist )/ \u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u0026#39; Organising Imports with isort isort automatically organises your import statements by type and alphabetically.\nInstall isort: pip install isort Run isort on your file: isort ratio_calculator.py For finance projects where you might be importing various data analysis libraries, isort keeps your imports clean and consistent:\n# Standard library imports import datetime import os from decimal import Decimal # Third-party imports import numpy as np import pandas as pd from matplotlib import pyplot as plt # Local application imports from .financial_models import discounted_cash_flow from .ratio_analysis import calculate_current_ratio Writing Effective Documentation Docstrings: Your Future Self Will Thank You Documentation isn\u0026rsquo;t just for others, it\u0026rsquo;s useful for you six months from now when you can\u0026rsquo;t remember why you wrote that complex financial calculation a certain way.\nGoogle Style Docstrings def calculate_npv(cash_flows, discount_rate): \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; Calculate Net Present Value of a series of cash flows.

This comes amid escalating tensions in global affairs, including US-China trade talks and increased immigration enforcement in the UK and US, with arrests of illegal migrant workers rising sharply. Domestically, economic shifts are evident in the NCAA\u0026rsquo;s approval of a $2.7 billion settlement allowing direct payments to college athletes, marking the end of amateurism in sports. Sentiment around AI rivalries and political enforcement actions has turned more adversarial, potentially influencing future policy and market dynamics. Overall, these trends underscore a world where technology, politics, and economics are increasingly intertwined, posing both opportunities and risks for stability.\nKey Trends \u0026amp; Sentiment Key Emerging Trends: 1. Rapid expansion of AI in government and security applications, as seen with Anthropic\u0026rsquo;s Claude AI for classified use. 2. Heightened immigration enforcement globally, with increased raids and arrests in the UK and US, reflecting stricter policies amid political shifts. Significant Sentiment Shifts: 1. Growing negativity toward corporate and governmental DEI initiatives, fueled by criticisms from figures like Trump, potentially eroding support for affirmative action. 2. Increasing adversarial sentiment in the AI sector, with rivalries between companies like Anthropic and OpenAI disrupting partnerships and innovation.

All concepts and frameworks are attributed to their original creators, primarily David Parmenter and other thought leaders in the field.\nThe Month-End Burden The month-end close process is often one of the most stressful and resource-intensive activities for finance teams. As David Parmenter states in \u0026ldquo;The Financial Controller and CFO\u0026rsquo;s Toolkit,\u0026rdquo; many organisations are trapped in a \u0026ldquo;month-end reporting death spiral\u0026rdquo; where teams spend weeks preparing reports that arrive too late to influence decision-making.\nAccording to Parmenter\u0026rsquo;s research, the average finance team spends 8-10 working days on the month-end close, with some taking 15+ days. By the time reports are finalised, the information is already outdated. As Parmenter notes, \u0026ldquo;By day eight, it is too late to change the current month\u0026rsquo;s performance, and the next month is already well underway.\u0026rdquo;\nThis inefficiency creates several problems:\nValue erosion - Finance staff spend most of their time looking backward rather than forward Decision delay - Management makes decisions based on old information Resource drain - Excessive time spent on reporting leaves little capacity for analysis Staff burnout - The monthly rush creates stress and reduces job satisfaction Error risk - Rushed processes increase the likelihood of mistakes Parmenter\u0026rsquo;s Fast Close Methodology David Parmenter advocates for a radical rethinking of the month-end process, with the goal of completing the close within three working days. His \u0026ldquo;fast close\u0026rdquo; methodology is based on studying organisations that consistently close their books quickly and accurately.\nThe 10 Steps to Fast Close Success Parmenter outlines ten key steps for transforming your month-end process:\n1. Sell the Change to the Senior Management Team Quantify the cost of the current process Highlight the business benefits of faster information Set clear targets for improvement (e.g., close in 3 days within 6 months) 2. Document the Current Process in Detail Map every task in the current close Note who performs each task and how long it takes Identify dependencies between tasks 3. Ban Month-End Activities Before Month-End Stop any \u0026ldquo;soft closes\u0026rdquo; or pre-month-end activities Focus on getting the process right rather than starting early 4. Adopt Day One, Two, and Three Priorities Identify what must be completed on each day of the close Create a visual board showing daily targets and progress 5. Move Accounting Processes into the Front Office Train operational staff to code and enter transactions correctly Implement systems that capture accounting information at the source Use electronic workflows to automate approval processes 6. Limit Journal Entries Analyse root causes of recurring journals Fix underlying system issues rather than creating workarounds Implement materiality thresholds for adjustments 7. Identify and Minimise Bottlenecks Focus on the critical path activities Assign additional resources to bottleneck tasks Restructure processes to eliminate waiting time 8. Report Daily and Weekly KPIs Create a cadence of daily flash reports and weekly summaries Reduce the importance of month-end by providing more frequent updates 9. Replace Reports with Performance Dashboards Design user-friendly dashboards for different stakeholder groups Focus on key performance drivers, not just financial outcomes 10. Present Monthly Results on Day Three Conduct a disciplined review meeting with key stakeholders Focus on exceptions and trends rather than detailed variance analysis As Parmenter emphasises, \u0026ldquo;The fast close is not about working faster or longer hours; it\u0026rsquo;s about working smarter through process redesign.\u0026rdquo;\nProcess Mapping Your Current Close Before implementing changes, it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to thoroughly understand your current process. A detailed process map serves as the foundation for improvement initiatives.\nHow to Map Your Month-End Close Create a task inventory\nList every task performed during month-end Include who performs each task and estimated time Note dependencies between tasks Develop a visual timeline\nPlot tasks on a calendar showing start and end times Identify the critical path (tasks that determine overall duration) Highlight bottlenecks and waiting periods Categorise activities\nEssential vs. non-essential tasks Value-adding vs. non-value-adding activities Critical path vs. non-critical path items Document pain points\nInterview team members about challenges Identify recurring problems and their root causes Note areas with frequent errors or rework Sample Process Mapping Template Task Owner Duration Predecessors Value Add Critical Path? Improvement Opportunity Bank reconciliation AP Clerk 4 hours None Medium Yes Implement daily reconciliation Inventory valuation Cost Accountant 8 hours Physical count High Yes Automate using system calculations Accrue expenses Staff Accountant 6 hours AP cutoff Medium Yes Use standard accruals for predictable items Revenue recognition Revenue Accountant 5 hours Sales report High Yes Implement daily revenue recognition Consolidation Manager 10 hours Subsidiaries closed High Yes Create standardised templates Identifying and Eliminating Bottlenecks With a detailed process map in hand, you can focus on eliminating the bottlenecks that extend your close timeline.\nCommon Month-End Bottlenecks According to Parmenter\u0026rsquo;s research, these are the most common bottlenecks in the month-end process:\nIntercompany reconciliations - Discrepancies between related entities Fixed asset accounting - Late capitalisation of projects and additions Inventory valuation - Delayed count information or complex calculations Revenue recognition - Manual calculations for complex contracts Accruals and provisions - Waiting for information from operations Manual journal entries - Excessive adjustments requiring review and approval Consolidation - Waiting for subsidiary results or manual consolidation processes Strategies for Eliminating Bottlenecks For each bottleneck, consider these approaches:\nEliminate - Can the task be eliminated entirely? Automate - Can technology perform the task more efficiently? Simplify - Can the process be streamlined or standardised? Reallocate - Can resources be shifted to accelerate critical path activities? Move earlier - Can the task be performed before month-end? Move later - Can the task be performed after preliminary results are released? Technology Enablers for Faster Closing Technology plays a crucial role in accelerating the month-end close. Modern systems can automate routine tasks, enforce controls, and provide real-time visibility into the close process.\nKey Technologies for Fast Close ERP systems with built-in close management\nCentralised close calendars and task assignments Automated reconciliations and variance analysis System-generated journal entries for routine transactions Close management software\nSpecialised applications like BlackLine, Trintech, or FloQast Task tracking and status reporting Automated reconciliations and documentation Robotic Process Automation (RPA)\nSoftware \u0026ldquo;bots\u0026rdquo; that perform routine, rule-based tasks Particularly effective for data extraction, validation, and entry Can work 24/7 to prepare for the close Business Intelligence tools\nSelf-service reporting and visualisation tools Exception-based highlighting of unusual variances Drill-down capabilities for investigating issues Cloud-based collaboration platforms\nReal-time visibility into close status for all stakeholders Centralised documentation and audit trails Remote access for distributed teams As Parmenter notes, \u0026ldquo;While technology is an important enabler, it must be implemented alongside process improvements to achieve sustainable results.\u0026rdquo;\nCase Study: Companies That Close in 1-3 Days Several organisations have successfully transformed their month-end close processes to consistently deliver results within three days. Here\u0026rsquo;s a composite case study based on Parmenter\u0026rsquo;s research:\nGlobal Manufacturing Company Before Transformation:\n12-day close process 70% of finance time spent on transaction processing and reporting Over 1,000 manual journal entries each month 80-page monthly report that few executives read thoroughly Transformation Approach:\nMapped and analysed the entire close process Implemented daily flash reports for key metrics Reduced journal entries by 80% through system improvements Automated account reconciliations Implemented materiality thresholds for adjustments Created a digital close calendar with real-time status tracking Redesigned reports as one-page dashboards for each business unit Results:\nClose completed in 3 days Finance staff time on transaction processing reduced by 60% Error rates decreased by 75% Executive satisfaction with financial reporting increased significantly Finance team now spends more time on forward-looking analysis As the CFO commented, \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re no longer just reporting history; we\u0026rsquo;re helping to shape the future.\u0026rdquo;\nManaging the Transition: A Practical Roadmap Transforming your month-end close is a significant change management initiative. Here\u0026rsquo;s a phased approach based on Parmenter\u0026rsquo;s recommendations:\nPhase 1: Foundation (1-2 months) Secure executive sponsorship Document the current process in detail Benchmark against leading practices Set clear targets (e.g., 5-day close within 3 months, 3-day close within 6 months) Establish a cross-functional improvement team Phase 2: Quick Wins (2-3 months) Implement materiality thresholds for adjustments Standardise and templatise recurring journal entries Create a visual close calendar with clear task ownership Implement daily cutoffs for transaction processing Reduce the scope of month-end reports to essential information Phase 3: Process Redesign (3-6 months) Move reconciliations to daily or weekly cycles Implement continuous accounting principles Automate routine reconciliations and calculations Redesign the consolidation process Create exception-based review processes Phase 4: Sustainability (6+ months) Implement close management technology Create a continuous improvement mechanism Monitor and address emerging bottlenecks Train backup resources for key roles Expand the use of flash reports and rolling forecasts Building a Fast Close Culture Technical changes alone won\u0026rsquo;t create sustainable improvement. According to Parmenter, creating a fast close culture requires addressing behavioral and organisational elements:\nCelebrate progress - Recognise and reward improvements in close timing and quality Share the burden - Make the close a company-wide priority, not just a finance responsibility Enforce deadlines - Hold all departments accountable for providing timely information Focus on root causes - Address the underlying issues, not just the symptoms Encourage innovation - Create space for team members to suggest improvements Train for versatility - Cross-train team members to eliminate single points of failure Self-Assessment: How Efficient Is Your Close? Rate your organisation on these dimensions from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree):\nOur month-end close is completed within 5 working days We have mapped and documented our entire close process We have eliminated most manual journal entries Our reconciliations are performed on a daily or weekly basis We use technology to automate routine close activities Our close process has clearly defined owners for each task We provide flash reports throughout the month, not just at month-end We have materiality thresholds for month-end adjustments Our finance team has time for analysis, not just processing and reporting We continuously improve our close process Scoring:\n40-50: Leading practice 30-39: Good practice with room for improvement 20-29: Significant improvement opportunities 10-19: Transformational change needed Action Items for Finance Leaders Time your current close - Document how long each component of your close actually takes Calculate the cost - Estimate the total cost of your close process (people, systems, opportunity cost) Map your process - Create a visual representation of your current close activities Identify your bottlenecks - Determine which activities are on the critical path Set clear targets - Establish specific goals for close duration and quality Start small - Implement one or two quick wins to build momentum Measure and communicate progress - Track improvements and share results widely Conclusion Transforming your month-end close process represents one of the most significant opportunities to improve finance function efficiency and effectiveness. By following Parmenter\u0026rsquo;s fast close methodology, you can free up valuable resources for more strategic activities while providing more timely information to decision-makers.\nAs David Parmenter emphasises, \u0026ldquo;The month-end close is not an end in itself but a means to provide timely information for decision-making.\u0026rdquo; By adopting the principles outlined in this post, you can begin shifting your finance function from backward-looking scorekeeping to forward-looking business partnership.\nReferences Parmenter, D.

Meanwhile, the AI sector is booming but facing backlash due to a 150% surge in emissions from data centers and cloud computing, as reported by the UN. Globally, Europe\u0026rsquo;s role in countering Russia intensifies as the US scales back support for Ukraine, while domestic issues like UK political shifts and environmental crises in Gaza and India highlight broader instability. In the UK, Labour\u0026rsquo;s surprise by-election win in Hamilton signals potential momentum ahead of future elections, amid concerns over criminal justice failures and policy debates.\nKey economic updates include a moderation in India\u0026rsquo;s net FDI due to increased repatriation, as noted by the RBI, and a soaring IPO for stablecoin issuer Circle, reflecting fintech resilience. These events underscore growing geopolitical risks, environmental strains from tech advancements, and shifting alliances that could influence markets and international relations.\nKey Trends \u0026amp; Sentiment Key Emerging Trends: 1. Rapid AI growth is driving a surge in energy consumption and emissions, potentially reshaping sustainability efforts. 2. Political realignments, such as the Musk-Trump fallout and UK party shifts, are fostering volatility in global alliances and domestic policies. Significant Sentiment Shifts: 1. Increasing skepticism toward AI\u0026rsquo;s environmental impact is shifting public and investor sentiment from optimism to concern. 2. Anti-establishment figures like Musk clashing with Trump indicate a broader erosion of traditional conservative unity. Key Future Implication: This could lead to stricter regulations on AI and tech emissions, prompting companies to invest in greener innovations to mitigate long-term economic and environmental risks. Key Developments 1. Tech \u0026amp; AI Developments\nThe UN reported a 150% surge in emissions from tech giants due to AI, cloud computing, and data centers between 2020 and 2023, driven by the AI boom. This breakthrough highlights growing sustainability challenges amid rapid innovation. Immediate market impact includes potential investor pullback from high-emission tech firms, as scrutiny rises. Significance: High (70 words).\n2. UK Political News\nLabour\u0026rsquo;s unexpected victory in the Hamilton by-election defied predictions, bolstering their position against the SNP and Reform UK. Key party reactions include relief from Labour leader Keir Starmer and criticism from Reform UK, citing internal resignations like Zia Yusuf\u0026rsquo;s as a setback. This signals potential shifts in voter dynamics ahead of national polls. Significance: High (52 words).\n3. Global Affairs\nThe US is reducing support for Ukraine, leaving Europe to confront Russia alone, as highlighted in reports on potential policy shifts under Trump. Regional implications include heightened security risks for NATO allies and increased European defense spending. This development underscores growing transatlantic divisions. Significance: High (56 words).\n4. Economic \u0026amp; Financial Updates\nCircle\u0026rsquo;s IPO soared 167% on its first day, reflecting strong demand for stablecoins amid fintech growth. RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das noted India\u0026rsquo;s FDI moderation due to repatriation, with gross inflows up 14%. Policy impacts include potential regulatory adjustments to attract foreign investment. Significance: Medium (48 words).\n5. Climate \u0026amp; Environment\nThe UN warned of a 150% emissions surge from tech giants due to AI expansion, exacerbating global warming. This development prompts calls for policy changes, such as stricter carbon regulations on data centers. It highlights the need for sustainable tech practices to curb environmental damage. Significance: High (52 words).\nKey Takeaways Most Important Implications: 1. AI\u0026rsquo;s environmental toll could accelerate global regulations, forcing tech firms to adopt sustainable practices and impacting innovation timelines. 2. Escalating US-Europe tensions over Ukraine may lead to higher defense budgets and economic strain in the region. 3. UK political shifts, like Labour\u0026rsquo;s win, could influence social policies, such as benefit caps, affecting domestic inequality. Developments to Watch: 1. The Musk-Trump feud and its effects on Republican strategies in upcoming US elections. 2. AI emissions regulations, as they evolve and influence corporate profitability.

Without virtual environments, you\u0026rsquo;d be forced to choose one version for your entire system, potentially breaking one of your applications.\nVirtual environments solve this problem by creating isolated Python installations for each project. Benefits include:\nDependency isolation: Each project can have its own versions of packages Reproducibility: Easily share environment specifications with colleagues Clean testing: Test in environments that match production settings Avoiding permission issues: Install packages without admin privileges Creating and Managing Virtual Environments Python comes with the venv module built-in, which is the recommended way to create virtual environments.\nCreating a Virtual Environment on Windows Open Command Prompt and navigate to your project directory:\ncd C:\\Users\\YourName\\Documents\\financial-analysis-project Create a new virtual environment:\npython -m venv env This creates a directory named env containing a copy of the Python interpreter and the standard library.\nActivating the Virtual Environment On Windows:\nenv\\Scripts\\activate You\u0026rsquo;ll notice your command prompt changes to show the active environment:\n(env) C:\\Users\\YourName\\Documents\\financial-analysis-project\u0026gt; If you\u0026rsquo;re using PowerShell instead of Command Prompt on Windows, the commands are slightly different:\n.\\env\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1 If you encounter execution policy restrictions, you may need to allow script execution:\nSet-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser Now any Python commands will use this isolated environment.\nNotes for macOS/Linux The process is similar on macOS and Linux, with slight differences:\nCreate: python3 -m venv env Activate: source env/bin/activate Deactivating the Virtual Environment When you\u0026rsquo;re done working on your project:\ndeactivate Your prompt will return to normal, and Python commands will use the system interpreter again.\nManaging Packages with pip pip is Python\u0026rsquo;s package installer, and it\u0026rsquo;s the primary tool for adding external libraries to your environments.\nInstalling Packages Once your virtual environment is activated, install packages with:\npip install package-name For example, to install key financial packages:\npip install pandas numpy matplotlib openpyxl xlrd You can also specify exact versions:\npip install pandas==1.5.3 Or version ranges:\npip install pandas\u0026gt;=1.4.0,\u0026lt;2.0.0 Listing Installed Packages To see what\u0026rsquo;s installed in your environment:\npip list Output example:\nPackage Version\r--------------- -------\rmatplotlib 3.7.1\rnumpy 1.24.3\ropenpyxl 3.1.2\rpandas 1.5.3\rpip 23.1.2\rpython-dateutil 2.8.2\rpytz 2023.3\rsetuptools 65.6.3\rsix 1.16.0\rtzdata 2023.3\rxlrd 2.0.1 Freezing Requirements When you want to share your project, it\u0026rsquo;s important to specify exactly which packages and versions it needs. The freeze command creates a requirements file:\npip freeze \u0026gt; requirements.txt This generates a text file with all installed packages and their versions:\n# requirements.txt contents\rmatplotlib==3.7.1\rnumpy==1.24.3\ropenpyxl==3.1.2\rpandas==1.5.3\rpython-dateutil==2.8.2\rpytz==2023.3\rsix==1.16.0\rtzdata==2023.3\rxlrd==2.0.1 Installing from Requirements When someone else (or you on a different machine) wants to recreate your environment:\npip install -r requirements.txt This is essential for collaborative financial projects where everyone needs the same libraries and versions.\nPractical Example: Setting Up a Financial Analysis Environment Let\u0026rsquo;s walk through creating a virtual environment for a financial analysis project:\n# Create project directory mkdir financial_analysis cd financial_analysis # Create and activate virtual environment python -m venv env env\\Scripts\\activate # Install required packages pip install pandas numpy matplotlib openpyxl xlsxwriter jupyter # Verify installations pip list # Create requirements.txt pip freeze \u0026gt; requirements.txt # Create a marker file for your project echo # Financial Analysis Project \u0026gt; README.md Basic Package Structure As your financial tools grow more complex, you might want to create your own Python packages that you can reuse across projects or share with colleagues.\nProject Structure A typical Python package structure looks like this:\nfinancial_tools/\r│\r├── pyproject.toml # Modern project configuration\r├── README.md # Documentation\r├── LICENSE # License information\r│\r└── src/ # Source code directory\r└── financial_tools/ # Actual package\r├── __init__.py # Makes it a package\r├── analysis.py # Analysis module\r├── reporting.py # Reporting module\r└── utils.py # Utility functions The __init__.py File This file marks a directory as a Python package and can be used to define what gets imported when someone uses your package:\n# src/financial_tools/__init__.py # Version information __version__ = \u0026#39;0.1.0\u0026#39; # Import commonly used functions for easier access from .analysis import calculate_roi, calculate_npv from .reporting import generate_monthly_report Setting Up a Package with pyproject.toml Modern Python packaging uses pyproject.toml for configuration:\n[build-system] requires = [\u0026#34;setuptools\u0026gt;=42\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;wheel\u0026#34;] build-backend = \u0026#34;setuptools.build_meta\u0026#34; [project] name = \u0026#34;financial_tools\u0026#34; version = \u0026#34;0.1.0\u0026#34; description = \u0026#34;Tools for financial analysis and reporting\u0026#34; readme = \u0026#34;README.md\u0026#34; authors = [ {name = \u0026#34;Your Name\u0026#34;, email = \u0026#34;your.email@example.com\u0026#34;} ] license = {text = \u0026#34;MIT\u0026#34;} classifiers = [ \u0026#34;Programming Language :: Python :: 3\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Operating System :: OS Independent\u0026#34;, ] dependencies = [ \u0026#34;pandas\u0026gt;=1.3.0\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;numpy\u0026gt;=1.20.0\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;matplotlib\u0026gt;=3.4.0\u0026#34;, ] requires-python = \u0026#34;\u0026gt;=3.8\u0026#34; [project.urls] \u0026#34;Homepage\u0026#34; = \u0026#34;https://github.com/yourusername/financial_tools\u0026#34; \u0026#34;Bug Tracker\u0026#34; = \u0026#34;https://github.com/yourusername/financial_tools/issues\u0026#34; [project.optional-dependencies] dev = [ \u0026#34;pytest\u0026gt;=6.0\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;black\u0026gt;=21.5b2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;flake8\u0026gt;=3.9\u0026#34;, ] excel = [ \u0026#34;openpyxl\u0026gt;=3.0.0\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;xlsxwriter\u0026gt;=1.4.0\u0026#34;, ] Building and Installing Your Package With your package structure set up, you can install it in development mode:\npip install -e . This makes the package available but still editable in its original location.\nPublishing to PyPI When your financial package is ready to share with the world, you can publish it to the Python Package Index (PyPI).\nBuild Distribution Packages First, make sure you have the build tools:\npip install build twine Then create distribution packages:\npython -m build This will create a directory called dist with distribution files.\nUpload to PyPI Use twine to upload your package:\ntwine upload dist/* You\u0026rsquo;ll need to create an account on PyPI before uploading.\nVersioning Best Practices For financial software where accuracy is critical, proper versioning is essential:\nUse Semantic Versioning: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH\nMAJOR: Incompatible API changes MINOR: New features, backward-compatible PATCH: Bug fixes, backward-compatible Document Changes: Keep a CHANGELOG.md file\nVersion Bumping: Update version in one place only (pyproject.toml)\nGit Tags: Tag releases in your version control system\ngit tag -a v0.1.0 -m \u0026#34;Initial release\u0026#34;

This post is the start of my journey as I get to grips with the language. This guide will focus on SQL from a finance perspective, focusing on practical applications that will make your finance job easier.\nMost finance roles don\u0026rsquo;t require detailed knowledge of SQL (at the level of a software engineer). Understanding basic commands, and what your code is doing, can be useful; both when it comes to code issues and process improvements you\u0026rsquo;re implementing.\nWhat Exactly Is SQL and Why Should Finance Professionals Care? SQL (usually pronounced \u0026ldquo;sequel\u0026rdquo;) stands for Structured Query Language. It\u0026rsquo;s the standard language used to communicate with databases. But what does that really mean for someone in finance?\nAt its core, SQL allows you to:\nExtract specific financial data from large datasets Transform and summarise that data quickly Perform complex financial calculations across thousands or millions of records Create consistent, reproducible financial reports Combine data from multiple sources (like your ERP, CRM, and other systems) Think of SQL as a supercharged version of Excel formulas and pivot tables, but capable of handling far larger datasets and more complex operations.\nWhy I\u0026rsquo;m Learning SQL as a Finance Manager The promise of SQL for finance work is compelling: faster reporting, deeper analysis, and the ability to work with datasets that would crash Excel. I\u0026rsquo;m documenting my learning process here as I figure out how to make SQL work for finance professionals like us.\nHow Databases Work: The Basics You Need to Know Before diving into SQL itself, let\u0026rsquo;s understand the environment where SQL operates. In simple terms, a database is an organised collection of data stored in tables.\nDatabase Tables: Just Like Excel, But More Powerful If you\u0026rsquo;re familiar with Excel (and what finance person isn\u0026rsquo;t?), you already understand the basic concept of tables:\nTables have rows and columns Each column contains a specific type of data Each row represents a single record or transaction The key difference? Database tables can easily handle millions of rows without slowing down, and they can be linked together in sophisticated ways that Excel can\u0026rsquo;t match.\nCommon Financial Database Tables In a typical financial database, you might find tables like:\nTransactions: Individual financial transactions Accounts: Chart of accounts Customers: Customer information Vendors: Vendor details Employees: Employee information GL_Entries: General ledger entries AP_Invoices: Accounts payable invoices AR_Invoices: Accounts receivable invoices These tables are connected through relationships. For example, a transaction might be linked to a specific customer through a customer ID.\nSQL Basics: The Commands You\u0026rsquo;ll Use Most Often Let\u0026rsquo;s start with the essential SQL commands that should cover most of your needs as a finance professional. I\u0026rsquo;m learning these in roughly this order:\nSELECT: Getting the Data You Want The SELECT statement is the workhorse of SQL. It retrieves data from one or more tables:\nSELECT invoice_number, customer_name, invoice_amount, due_date FROM invoices; This is equivalent to viewing specific columns in an Excel spreadsheet. Pretty straightforward once you get used to the syntax.\nWHERE: Filtering Your Data WHERE clauses let you filter results, similar to using Excel\u0026rsquo;s filter feature:\nSELECT invoice_number, customer_name, invoice_amount, due_date FROM invoices WHERE invoice_amount \u0026gt; 10000 AND due_date \u0026lt; \u0026#39;2023-12-31\u0026#39;; This query finds all large invoices due before the end of 2023 - perfect for cash flow forecasting. The logic is similar to Excel\u0026rsquo;s IF statements, but more powerful.\nORDER BY: Sorting Your Results ORDER BY sorts your results, just like sorting in Excel:\nSELECT invoice_number, customer_name, invoice_amount FROM invoices ORDER BY invoice_amount DESC; This would show your largest invoices first - great for identifying your biggest accounts receivable items.\nGROUP BY \u0026amp; Aggregate Functions: The Power of Summarisation This is where SQL starts to get interesting for financial analysis. GROUP BY lets you summarise data:\nSELECT customer_name, SUM(invoice_amount) as total_sales, COUNT(invoice_number) as invoice_count, AVG(invoice_amount) as average_invoice FROM invoices GROUP BY customer_name ORDER BY total_sales DESC; This query provides customer sales analysis showing total sales, number of invoices, and average invoice amount per customer - the kind of analysis that requires pivot tables in Excel.\nJOIN: Combining Data from Multiple Tables JOIN clauses connect related tables. This is like VLOOKUP but much more powerful:\nSELECT i.invoice_number, c.customer_name, c.industry, i.invoice_amount, i.payment_date, i.due_date FROM invoices i JOIN customers c ON i.customer_id = c.customer_id WHERE i.payment_date IS NULL; This query finds all unpaid invoices with customer details included - perfect for collections follow-up. JOINs were confusing at first, but they\u0026rsquo;re game-changers once you understand them.\nSome Practical SQL Examples for Finance Here are examples I\u0026rsquo;m working through as I learn. These represent common finance tasks that could benefit from SQL:\n1. Basic Aging Accounts Receivable Report SELECT c.customer_name, SUM(CASE WHEN DATEDIFF(day, i.due_date, GETDATE()) \u0026lt;= 30 THEN i.remaining_amount ELSE 0 END) as \u0026#39;0-30_days\u0026#39;, SUM(CASE WHEN DATEDIFF(day, i.due_date, GETDATE()) BETWEEN 31 AND 60 THEN i.remaining_amount ELSE 0 END) as \u0026#39;31-60_days\u0026#39;, SUM(CASE WHEN DATEDIFF(day, i.due_date, GETDATE()) BETWEEN 61 AND 90 THEN i.remaining_amount ELSE 0 END) as \u0026#39;61-90_days\u0026#39;, SUM(CASE WHEN DATEDIFF(day, i.due_date, GETDATE()) \u0026gt; 90 THEN i.remaining_amount ELSE 0 END) as \u0026#39;Over_90_days\u0026#39;, SUM(i.remaining_amount) as total_outstanding FROM invoices i JOIN customers c ON i.customer_id = c.customer_id WHERE i.remaining_amount \u0026gt; 0 GROUP BY c.customer_name ORDER BY total_outstanding DESC; This query produces an aging AR report broken down by customer and aging buckets. I haven\u0026rsquo;t gotten this working in practice yet, but conceptually it makes sense - it\u0026rsquo;s doing what I\u0026rsquo;d normally do with pivot tables and formulas in Excel.\n2. Simple Cash Flow View SELECT DATEADD(week, DATEDIFF(week, 0, due_date), 0) as week_starting, SUM(CASE WHEN transaction_type = \u0026#39;AP\u0026#39; THEN -amount ELSE 0 END) as outflows, SUM(CASE WHEN transaction_type = \u0026#39;AR\u0026#39; THEN amount ELSE 0 END) as inflows, SUM(CASE WHEN transaction_type = \u0026#39;AR\u0026#39; THEN amount ELSE -amount END) as net_cash_flow FROM projected_cash_transactions WHERE due_date BETWEEN GETDATE() AND DATEADD(month, 3, GETDATE()) GROUP BY DATEADD(week, DATEDIFF(week, 0, due_date), 0) ORDER BY week_starting; This attempts to forecast weekly cash flows for the next three months.\n3. Budget vs. Actual Analysis SELECT a.account_name, a.account_category, SUM(b.budget_amount) as annual_budget, SUM(b.budget_amount) * (MONTH(GETDATE()) / 12.0) as YTD_budget, SUM(t.amount) as YTD_actual, SUM(t.amount) - (SUM(b.budget_amount) * (MONTH(GETDATE()) / 12.0)) as variance, CASE WHEN SUM(b.budget_amount) * (MONTH(GETDATE()) / 12.0) = 0 THEN NULL ELSE (SUM(t.amount) / (SUM(b.budget_amount) * (MONTH(GETDATE()) / 12.0))) - 1 END as variance_percent FROM gl_accounts a LEFT JOIN budget b ON a.account_id = b.account_id AND b.budget_year = YEAR(GETDATE()) LEFT JOIN transactions t ON a.account_id = t.account_id AND YEAR(t.transaction_date) = YEAR(GETDATE()) GROUP BY a.account_name, a.account_category ORDER BY a.account_category, variance_percent DESC; This produces a budget vs. actual report with variance analysis. This shows how SQL could replace manual variance reporting.\nGetting Started with SQL as a Finance Professional Based on my learning so far, here\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;d recommend for others looking to pick up SQL:\n1. Set Up a Practice Environment You don\u0026rsquo;t need access to your company\u0026rsquo;s production database to start learning. I\u0026rsquo;m using:\nSQL Server Express (free version of Microsoft SQL Server) MySQL Community Edition (free and widely used) SQLite (super lightweight, good for beginners) Online SQL practice platforms like SQLFiddle, DB-Fiddle, or SQLZoo I started with an online platform to get the basics, then moved to SQL Server Express for more realistic practice.\n2. Create Some Sample Financial Data To practice, I created a few basic tables that mimic financial data. It\u0026rsquo;s helpful to work with data that resembles what you see at work:\n-- Create a customers table CREATE TABLE customers ( customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY, customer_name VARCHAR(100), industry VARCHAR(50), credit_limit DECIMAL(15,2), payment_terms INT ); -- Create an invoices table CREATE TABLE invoices ( invoice_id INT PRIMARY KEY, customer_id INT, invoice_number VARCHAR(20), invoice_date DATE, due_date DATE, invoice_amount DECIMAL(15,2), payment_date DATE NULL, remaining_amount DECIMAL(15,2) ); Then insert some sample data to practice queries. Working with familiar financial concepts makes the learning process much more relevant.\n3. Start with Simple Queries Don\u0026rsquo;t jump straight to complex JOINs and subqueries. I started with:\nBasic SELECT statements Adding WHERE clauses for filtering Simple GROUP BY for summarisation Basic JOINs between two tables Build complexity gradually as you get comfortable with each concept.\n4. Learn Your Database System Different database systems (SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, etc.) have slightly different SQL dialects. Since many finance departments use Microsoft products, SQL Server is often a good place to start.\nChallenges as a Finance Person Learning SQL Here are some obstacles that finance professionals might relate to:\n1. Getting Database Access at Work IT departments are protective of database access (for good reason). Work on getting read-only access to your financial systems.\n2. Understanding Our Company\u0026rsquo;s Database Structure ERP systems have complex database structures with cryptic table names. Finding the right tables and understanding how they connect is half the battle.\n3. Bridging the Gap Between Excel and SQL I keep thinking in Excel terms and trying to replicate Excel processes in SQL. Learning to think in SQL terms takes time but is important for using SQL effectively.\nWhat I Hope to Achieve with SQL My goals for learning SQL are pretty practical:\nAutomate routine monthly reports Create better analytical tools for financial analysis Reduce the time spent on data preparation Build more sophisticated financial models Respond faster to ad-hoc data requests I\u0026rsquo;m not trying to become a database expert, just competent enough to make my finance work more efficient.\nLearning Resources I\u0026rsquo;m Using Here are resources that are helping me learn SQL specifically for finance applications:\nOnline Courses:\nW3Schools SQL Tutorial - Great for basics SQLCourse.com - Basic SQL tutorial YouTube tutorials for SQL Server basics Books I\u0026rsquo;m Considering:\n\u0026ldquo;Practical SQL\u0026rdquo; by Anthony DeBarros (recommended by several people) \u0026ldquo;SQL for Financial Analysis\u0026rdquo; by Matt Goldwasser Practice Sites:\nSQLFiddle.com for testing queries HackerRank SQL challenges (though some are quite advanced) The key seems to be consistent practice with realistic data that resembles what we work with in finance.\nNext Steps in My SQL Journey I\u0026rsquo;m planning to focus on:\nGetting more comfortable with JOINs between multiple tables Learning more about date functions for financial reporting Understanding how to optimise queries for better performance Exploring how to connect SQL results back to Excel for final formatting Eventually getting access to practice with real company data (with proper permissions) SQL feels like one of those skills that could really change how I approach financial analysis. I\u0026rsquo;m still in the early stages, but I can already see the potential. I\u0026rsquo;ll keep documenting what I learn as I go - both the successes and the frustrations that come with picking up a new technical skill as a finance professional.\nThe goal isn\u0026rsquo;t to become a programmer, just to add a powerful tool to the finance toolkit. Even basic SQL skills seem like they could save hours of manual work each month, which makes the learning investment worthwhile.\n","permalink":"https://michaelbrunger.com/sql-for-finance-professionals/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"sql-for-finance-professionals-a-practical-guide\"\u003eSQL for Finance Professionals: A Practical Guide\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a finance manager, learning SQL can be one of the most valuable skills that you can add to your professional toolkit.

All concepts and frameworks are attributed to their original creators, primarily David Parmenter and other thought leaders in the field.\nThe Problem with Traditional Annual Budgets Most organisations still cling to the annual budgeting process despite mounting evidence of its ineffectiveness. As David Parmenter points out in his book \u0026ldquo;The Financial Controller and CFO\u0026rsquo;s Toolkit,\u0026rdquo; traditional budgets often become outdated shortly after completion due to rapidly changing business conditions.\nAccording to Parmenter (2017), the traditional budgeting process suffers from several fundamental flaws:\nTime-consuming and expensive - Finance teams typically spend months preparing budgets that become obsolete within weeks Based on unsupported assumptions - Many budgets are built on guesswork rather than reliable forecasting techniques Encourages dysfunctional behaviors - Department managers often engage in \u0026ldquo;gaming the system,\u0026rdquo; padding budgets or spending unnecessarily to protect future allocations Disconnected from strategy - Annual budgets rarely align with the organisation\u0026rsquo;s strategic objectives Too rigid for today\u0026rsquo;s dynamic business environment - Annual budgets lack the flexibility to adapt to rapidly changing market conditions As Parmenter notes, \u0026ldquo;Annual planning is a relic of the past and was designed for a stable, predictable business environment that no longer exists.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Beyond Budgeting Movement Jeremy Hope and Robin Fraser pioneered the \u0026ldquo;Beyond Budgeting\u0026rdquo; movement that provides a radical alternative to traditional budgeting processes. Their research, documented in \u0026ldquo;Beyond Budgeting: How Managers Can Break Free from the Annual Performance Trap\u0026rdquo; (2003), identified twelve principles for organisations seeking to move beyond conventional budgeting approaches.\nCore Beyond Budgeting Principles Performance Management Principles: Set relative goals rather than fixed targets Reward shared success based on relative performance, not meeting fixed targets Make planning a continuous and inclusive process Make resources available as needed, not through annual budget allocations Coordinate cross-company interactions dynamically, not through annual plans Base controls on KPIs, trends, and relative indicators, not budget variances Leadership Principles: Provide a governance framework based on clear values and boundaries Create a high-performance climate based on relative success Delegate decision-making authority to operational managers Make teams accountable for customer outcomes Create a transparent information system providing fast, open information Use performance metrics to promote improvement, not control Parmenter\u0026rsquo;s Rolling Forecast Solution While completely abandoning budgets may be too dramatic a step for many organisations, Parmenter advocates for quarterly rolling forecasts as a practical middle ground. This approach maintains some structure while addressing many of the shortcomings of traditional budgeting.\nKey Elements of Quarterly Rolling Forecasts According to Parmenter (2017), an effective rolling forecast system includes:\nLooking out 5-6 quarters - Always maintaining a 12-18 month forward view Focusing on key drivers - Forecasting 10-12 key business variables rather than detailed line items Using current business knowledge - Incorporating the latest market intelligence and operational data Separating targets from forecasts - Ensuring forecasts represent the most likely outcome, not a target Completing within 5-6 working days - Making the process quick and efficient Involving the whole management team - Not just a finance exercise As Parmenter states, \u0026ldquo;Rolling forecasts should be light-touch forecasts focusing on key drivers that can be prepared quickly.\u0026rdquo;\nImplementation Roadmap: From Traditional to Rolling Forecasts Transitioning from traditional annual budgeting to rolling forecasts requires careful change management. Here\u0026rsquo;s a practical roadmap based on Parmenter\u0026rsquo;s recommendations:\nPhase 1: Preparation (3-6 months) Form a cross-functional implementation team Educate senior leadership on the limitations of traditional budgeting Identify key business drivers for forecasting Design a simplified forecasting template Establish a proof of concept with one business unit Document the proposed new process Phase 2: Implementation (6-12 months) Run traditional budgeting process alongside rolling forecasts Progressively reduce the detail in the annual budget Train finance team and business managers on new processes Implement supporting technology Begin reporting based on forecast variances rather than budget variances Review and refine the process Phase 3: Optimisation (12+ months) Phase out the traditional annual budget completely Integrate rolling forecasts with strategic planning Adjust performance evaluation and incentive systems Implement continuous improvement of the forecasting process Overcoming Resistance to Change Implementing rolling forecasts typically encounters resistance, particularly from those comfortable with the status quo. Parmenter suggests several strategies to address this resistance:\nFocus on benefits - Quantify the time savings and improved decision-making Start with a pilot - Demonstrate success in one department before rolling out company-wide Secure senior leadership support - Ensure the CFO and CEO champion the change Train extensively - Invest in developing new skills and capabilities Communicate constantly - Explain the \u0026ldquo;why\u0026rdquo; behind the changes Make it easier - Ensure new processes are simpler than the old ones Case Study: A Mid-Size Manufacturing Company A manufacturing company with $120 million in annual revenue implemented quarterly rolling forecasts based on Parmenter\u0026rsquo;s methodology. They identified 12 key business drivers, including:\nRaw material costs for key inputs Production volume by major product line Average selling price by product line Headcount in key departments Energy consumption Exchange rates for major currencies Their previous annual budgeting process took 12 weeks and produced a 50-page document. After implementing rolling forecasts, they could produce a comprehensive forecast in just 5 days that proved more accurate than their previous annual budget.\nThe finance team reported spending 70% less time on forecasting activities while providing more valuable information to decision-makers. In the first year alone, they identified $3.2 million in cost-saving opportunities that would have been missed under the traditional budgeting approach.\nIntegrating with Performance Management Hope and Fraser emphasise that beyond budgeting isn\u0026rsquo;t just a financial process change—it represents a fundamental shift in how organisations manage performance.\nTo fully realise the benefits, organisations should consider:\nSeparating target-setting from forecasting - Targets should stretch performance, while forecasts should be realistic Using relative performance measures - Comparing to competitors and past performance rather than fixed targets Implementing a balanced scorecard approach - As developed by Kaplan and Norton, to ensure financial and non-financial measures are considered Revising incentive systems - Moving from individual budget-based bonuses to team-based relative performance rewards Tools and Technology Enablers The right tools can significantly streamline the rolling forecast process. Options include:\nPurpose-built planning software - Solutions like Adaptive Insights, Anaplan, or Prophix Business intelligence tools - Power BI, Tableau, or QlikView for visualisation Enhanced spreadsheet models - More sophisticated Excel models with proper controls Cloud-based collaboration platforms - Enabling distributed teams to collaborate effectively Self-Assessment: Is Your Organisation Ready? Rate your organisation on these dimensions from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree):\nOur current budgeting process adds significant value to decision-making Our budgets remain relevant throughout the year Our budgeting process takes less than 4 weeks from start to finish Business managers view budgeting as a valuable exercise rather than a burden Our budgets support rather than hinder agile decision-making Our organisation could respond quickly to a major market disruption We regularly forecast beyond the current financial year Our forecasts focus on key business drivers rather than detailed line items Senior leaders would support significant changes to our budgeting process Scoring:\n36-45: You\u0026rsquo;re already embracing modern budgeting practices 27-35: Good foundation, but room for improvement 18-26: Significant modernisation needed 9-17: Traditional budgeting is likely causing organisational pain Action Items for Finance Leaders Document your current budgeting process - Map out steps, timelines, and resource requirements Identify your key business drivers - What truly moves the needle for your organisation? Build a simple rolling forecast model - Start with just the key drivers Experiment with a quarterly forecast - Run it alongside your current process Measure the time investment - Quantify how much effort goes into budgeting and forecasting Engage stakeholders - Discuss pain points and potential improvements with business partners Conclusion Moving beyond traditional budgeting represents one of the most significant opportunities for modern finance teams to add value to their organisations. By embracing more flexible, forward-looking approaches like rolling forecasts, finance leaders can provide more timely insights while freeing up valuable resources for more strategic activities.\nAs David Parmenter emphasises, \u0026ldquo;The annual planning process has been a major barrier to effective performance management.\u0026rdquo; By adopting the principles outlined in this post, you can begin transforming your finance function from a backwards-looking reporting entity to a forward-looking strategic partner.\nReferences Parmenter, D.

This comes amid growing scrutiny of tech leaders, with reports highlighting Elon Musk\u0026rsquo;s increased drug use during the 2024 US presidential campaign, raising concerns about corporate governance. Internationally, Ukraine has hesitated to commit to new talks with Russia, underscoring ongoing geopolitical tensions, while in the UK, former Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams won a libel case against the BBC, reflecting sensitivities around historical political violence. These events signal heightened regulatory pressures and political uncertainties that could influence global markets and alliances.\nAdditionally, US defense advancements, such as the unveiling of the MV-75 tiltrotor aircraft to replace the Black Hawk, emphasize military modernization amid strategic threats. Economic highlights include a massive bonus for Ryanair\u0026rsquo;s CEO, amid probes into political figures like Nashville\u0026rsquo;s mayor for blocking immigration enforcement, pointing to broader themes of leadership accountability and fiscal disparities.\nKey Trends \u0026amp; Sentiment Key Emerging Trends: 1.

Let\u0026rsquo;s explore how Python handles functions, modules, and file operations - all essential skills for financial analysis and reporting.\nDefining and Calling Functions Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They help keep your code DRY (Don\u0026rsquo;t Repeat Yourself) and make it more maintainable.\nBasic Function Syntax def function_name(parameters): \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;Docstring explaining what the function does.\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; # Function body return result # Optional Here\u0026rsquo;s a simple function that calculates compound interest:\ndef calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time, compounds_per_year=1): \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; Calculate compound interest. Args: principal: Initial investment amount rate: Annual interest rate (as decimal, e.g., 0.05 for 5%) time: Time period in years compounds_per_year: Number of times interest compounds per year (default=1) Returns: The final amount after compound interest \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; return principal * (1 + rate/compounds_per_year)**(compounds_per_year*time) Let\u0026rsquo;s call this function:\n# Calculate investment growth at 5% interest, compounded quarterly for 10 years initial_investment = 10000 final_amount = calculate_compound_interest( principal=initial_investment, rate=0.05, time=10, compounds_per_year=4 ) print(f\u0026#34;${initial_investment} will grow to ${final_amount:.2f} after 10 years\u0026#34;) Output:\n$10000 will grow to $16470.09 after 10 years Function Arguments Python offers flexible ways to handle function arguments:\nPositional vs. Keyword Arguments # Positional arguments (order matters) result1 = calculate_compound_interest(10000, 0.05, 10, 4) # Keyword arguments (order doesn\u0026#39;t matter) result2 = calculate_compound_interest( rate=0.05, principal=10000, compounds_per_year=4, time=10 ) Default Parameter Values In our function, compounds_per_year=1 provides a default value if not specified:\n# Using the default compounds_per_year (annual compounding) annual_result = calculate_compound_interest(10000, 0.05, 10) print(f\u0026#34;With annual compounding: ${annual_result:.2f}\u0026#34;) Variable Number of Arguments For functions that need to accept varying numbers of arguments:\n# *args collects extra positional arguments as a tuple def sum_all_values(*args): \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;Sum any number of values.\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; return sum(args) # **kwargs collects extra keyword arguments as a dictionary def create_financial_report(report_date, **kwargs): \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;Create a financial report with flexible data points.\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; report = {\u0026#34;date\u0026#34;: report_date} report.update(kwargs) return report # Example usage total = sum_all_values(100, 250, 300, 75) print(f\u0026#34;Total: ${total}\u0026#34;) report = create_financial_report( \u0026#34;2025-04-28\u0026#34;, revenue=150000, expenses=95000, net_profit=55000, profit_margin=0.37 ) print(report) Variable Scope and Namespaces Understanding scope is crucial for debugging and writing clean code.\nLocal vs. Global Scope total_assets = 1000000 # Global variable def calculate_roi(profit): investment = 100000 # Local variable return profit / investment * 100 # investment is not accessible here print(f\u0026#34;Total assets: ${total_assets}\u0026#34;) roi = calculate_roi(25000) print(f\u0026#34;ROI: {roi}%\u0026#34;) Local variables exist only within their function. Global variables can be accessed inside functions, but to modify them, you need the global keyword:\nbalance = 5000 # Global variable def deposit(amount): global balance # Tell Python we want to modify the global variable balance += amount return balance def withdraw(amount): global balance if balance \u0026gt;= amount: balance -= amount return balance else: return \u0026#34;Insufficient funds\u0026#34; print(f\u0026#34;Initial balance: ${balance}\u0026#34;) deposit(1000) print(f\u0026#34;After deposit: ${balance}\u0026#34;) withdraw(2000) print(f\u0026#34;After withdrawal: ${balance}\u0026#34;) Namespaces Python uses namespaces to organise names and avoid conflicts. Each module, function, and class has its own namespace.\nOrganising Code into Modules and Packages As your financial scripts grow, organising code becomes essential.\nModules A module is simply a .py file containing code. Let\u0026rsquo;s create a financial utilities module:\n# financial_utils.py def calculate_roi(profit, investment): \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;Calculate Return on Investment as a percentage.\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; return (profit / investment) * 100 def calculate_npv(cash_flows, discount_rate): \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; Calculate Net Present Value of a series of cash flows. Args: cash_flows: List of cash flows, where index 0 is the initial investment (negative) discount_rate: Discount rate as decimal (e.g., 0.1 for 10%) \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; npv = 0 for t, cash_flow in enumerate(cash_flows): npv += cash_flow / (1 + discount_rate) ** t return npv To use this module:\n# main.py import financial_utils # Calculate ROI investment = 50000 profit = 12500 roi = financial_utils.calculate_roi(profit, investment) print(f\u0026#34;ROI: {roi}%\u0026#34;) # Calculate NPV of a project cash_flows = [-100000, 30000, 35000, 45000, 50000] # Initial investment + 4 years of returns npv = financial_utils.calculate_npv(cash_flows, 0.08) print(f\u0026#34;NPV: ${npv:.2f}\u0026#34;) You can also import specific functions:\nfrom financial_utils import calculate_roi, calculate_npv # Now use without the module prefix roi = calculate_roi(12500, 50000) Packages Packages are directories containing multiple modules. They require an __init__.py file (which can be empty) to be recognised as packages.\nfinance_package/\r├── __init__.py\r├── analysis.py\r├── reporting.py\r└── utils.py Using packages:\n# Import specific modules from a package from finance_package import analysis, reporting # Import specific functions from a module in a package from finance_package.utils import calculate_roi Exploring the Standard Library Python comes with a rich standard library. Here are some modules particularly useful for financial applications:\nMath Module import math # Calculate loan payment using the PMT formula principal = 250000 annual_rate = 0.04 # 4% years = 30 monthly_rate = annual_rate / 12 num_payments = years * 12 # Monthly payment formula payment = principal * (monthly_rate * math.pow(1 + monthly_rate, num_payments)) / (math.pow(1 + monthly_rate, num_payments) - 1) print(f\u0026#34;Monthly mortgage payment: ${payment:.2f}\u0026#34;) Random Module import random # Simulate stock price movements (very simplified) starting_price = 100 daily_volatility = 0.015 # 1.5% prices = [starting_price] for day in range(30): change = random.normalvariate(0, daily_volatility) new_price = prices[-1] * (1 + change) prices.append(new_price) print(f\u0026#34;Starting price: ${starting_price:.2f}\u0026#34;) print(f\u0026#34;Ending price: ${prices[-1]:.2f}\u0026#34;) print(f\u0026#34;30-day return: {(prices[-1]/prices[0] - 1) * 100:.2f}%\u0026#34;) Datetime Module from datetime import datetime, timedelta # Calculate business days between dates def business_days_between(start_date, end_date): \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;Count business days between two dates (excluding weekends).\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; days = 0 current_date = start_date while current_date \u0026lt;= end_date: # Monday = 0, Sunday = 6 if current_date.weekday() \u0026lt; 5: # Only count weekdays (0-4) days += 1 current_date += timedelta(days=1) return days # Calculate days until fiscal year end today = datetime.now() fiscal_year_end = datetime(today.year, 12, 31) if today \u0026gt; fiscal_year_end: fiscal_year_end = datetime(today.year + 1, 12, 31) business_days = business_days_between(today, fiscal_year_end) print(f\u0026#34;Business days until fiscal year end: {business_days}\u0026#34;) OS and Sys Modules import os import sys # Get the current working directory (useful for file paths) current_dir = os.getcwd() print(f\u0026#34;Current directory: {current_dir}\u0026#34;) # List all Excel files in the current directory excel_files = [file for file in os.listdir() if file.endswith((\u0026#39;.xlsx\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;.xls\u0026#39;))] print(\u0026#34;Excel files found:\u0026#34;) for file in excel_files: print(f\u0026#34;- {file}\u0026#34;) # Get Python version and platform information print(f\u0026#34;Python version: {sys.version}\u0026#34;) print(f\u0026#34;Platform: {sys.platform}\u0026#34;) Reading from/Writing to Text Files File operations are essential for financial data analysis, reporting, and automation.\nOpening and Closing Files The basic pattern is:\n# Open a file in read mode file = open(\u0026#39;data.txt\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;r\u0026#39;) # Do something with the file content = file.read() # Close the file file.close() However, this approach has problems if an error occurs before close(). The preferred way is using the with statement:\nThe with Statement # Automatically handles proper closing of the file with open(\u0026#39;data.txt\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;r\u0026#39;) as file: content = file.read() # File processing here # File is automatically closed when the block ends Reading Text Files Let\u0026rsquo;s work with a sample CSV file containing financial transactions:\n# Sample contents of transactions.csv: # date,description,amount # 2025-01-15,Office supplies,-129.99 # 2025-01-18,Client payment,1500.00 # 2025-01-22,Software subscription,-49.99 # 2025-01-30,Consulting fees,2750.00 with open(\u0026#39;transactions.csv\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;r\u0026#39;) as file: # Read the entire file as a single string content = file.read() print(\u0026#34;File contents:\u0026#34;) print(content) Reading line by line:\nwith open(\u0026#39;transactions.csv\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;r\u0026#39;) as file: # Skip header header = file.readline() # Initialise counters total_income = 0 total_expenses = 0 # Process each transaction for line in file: # Remove whitespace and split by comma date, description, amount = line.strip().split(\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;) # Convert amount to float amount = float(amount) if amount \u0026gt;= 0: total_income += amount else: total_expenses += amount print(f\u0026#34;Total income: ${total_income:.2f}\u0026#34;) print(f\u0026#34;Total expenses: ${total_expenses:.2f}\u0026#34;) print(f\u0026#34;Net cash flow: ${total_income + total_expenses:.2f}\u0026#34;) Writing to Text Files Let\u0026rsquo;s create a simple financial report:\n# Sample transaction data transactions = [ {\u0026#34;date\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2025-01-15\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Office supplies\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;amount\u0026#34;: -129.99}, {\u0026#34;date\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2025-01-18\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Client payment\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;amount\u0026#34;: 1500.00}, {\u0026#34;date\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2025-01-22\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Software subscription\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;amount\u0026#34;: -49.99}, {\u0026#34;date\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2025-01-30\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Consulting fees\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;amount\u0026#34;: 2750.00} ] # Calculate summary statistics total_income = sum(t[\u0026#34;amount\u0026#34;] for t in transactions if t[\u0026#34;amount\u0026#34;] \u0026gt;

A survey by Financial Executives International found that finance departments spend up to 30% of their time on report preparation, yet 65% of executives admit to reading only summaries or conclusions (FEI, 2023).\nAs David Parmenter observes in \u0026ldquo;Winning CFOs: Implementing and Applying Better Practices\u0026rdquo; (2012), \u0026ldquo;Most finance teams are producing a monthly financial pack that is more like a doorstop than a decision support tool.\u0026rdquo; This disconnect wastes valuable resources and misses the critical opportunity for finance to influence decision-making.\nThe Parmenter Approach to Lean Reporting David Parmenter\u0026rsquo;s reporting methodology represents a radical departure from traditional financial reporting practices. At its core is a simple but powerful principle: \u0026ldquo;Report the numbers that matter in a way that triggers action\u0026rdquo; (Parmenter, 2012).\nCore Elements of Parmenter\u0026rsquo;s Reporting Framework One-page reporting: Distilling complex information to a single page Exception reporting: Highlighting only significant variances Visual impact: Using graphs, charts, and visual cues instead of tables Forward focus: Emphasising forecasts over historical results Timeliness: Delivering information when it can still influence decisions As Parmenter states, \u0026ldquo;A finance team should aim to replace their fifty-page monthly report with a series of one-page reports\u0026rdquo; (Parmenter, 2010). This approach aligns with cognitive research showing decision-makers can effectively process limited information at once—typically 5-9 data points (Miller, 1956).\nWhy Traditional Financial Reports Fail Problem 1: Information Overload Traditional reports often provide exhaustive detail, overwhelming readers. Research by the American Psychological Association found that excessive information actually impairs decision quality (Schwartz, 2016).\nAccording to Edward Tufte, information design expert, \u0026ldquo;There is no more powerful way to selectively destroy information than to present too much of it\u0026rdquo; (Tufte, 2001).\nProblem 2: Format Over Function Many reports follow accounting formats rather than decision-making formats. Parmenter notes, \u0026ldquo;Traditional reports are structured for accountants, not for operational decision-makers\u0026rdquo; (Parmenter, 2010).\nProblem 3: Backward Focus Most financial reports emphasise what happened rather than what should happen next. As noted by Hope and Fraser in \u0026ldquo;Beyond Budgeting\u0026rdquo; (2003), \u0026ldquo;Traditional reporting is like driving by looking in the rearview mirror.\u0026rdquo;\nProblem 4: Delayed Delivery Monthly cycles create inherent information lags. By the time data is reported, the opportunity for timely intervention has often passed. Parmenter emphasises that \u0026ldquo;A late report, no matter how detailed, is of limited value\u0026rdquo; (Parmenter, 2010).\nProblem 5: Limited Context Numbers without context rarely drive action. Research by the Corporate Executive Board found that executives value contextual insights more than raw data (CEB, 2018).\nParmenter\u0026rsquo;s One-Page Reporting Methodology The Dashboard Approach At the center of Parmenter\u0026rsquo;s methodology is the dashboard concept—a single-page visual summary focused on critical metrics. In \u0026ldquo;Key Performance Indicators\u0026rdquo; (2015), he outlines specific design principles:\n5-second rule: Key messages should be absorbed in 5 seconds Trend emphasis: Show patterns over time, not just current values Exception highlighting: Use colour and formatting to flag issues Standardised layout: Consistent positioning of information Forward projection: Include forecast elements The \u0026ldquo;Report in One Page\u0026rdquo; Structure Parmenter recommends a specific one-page format (Parmenter, 2012):\nTop section: 3-5 critical KRIs with trend lines (25% of page) Middle section: 4-6 exception highlights requiring attention (50% of page) Bottom section: Brief narrative highlighting key insights (25% of page) This structure has been empirically tested to match executive information consumption patterns (Parmenter, 2015).\nImplementing Lean Reporting: A Step-by-Step Approach Step 1: Identify Information Needs Begin by understanding what decisions your reports should inform. As financial reporting expert Randall Bolten notes in \u0026ldquo;Painting with Numbers\u0026rdquo; (2012), \u0026ldquo;Effective reporting starts with understanding how the information will be used.\u0026rdquo;\nConduct stakeholder interviews: What decisions do they make monthly/weekly? Review meeting minutes: What recurring questions arise? Analyse information requests: What ad-hoc analyses are frequently requested? Step 2: Audit Current Reports Before creating new reports, evaluate existing ones. Parmenter recommends a structured audit (Parmenter, 2012):\nVolume analysis: Count pages, charts, tables in current reporting Usage tracking: Monitor which sections are referenced in meetings Time allocation: Track preparation time for each report element Decision impact: Identify which reports have triggered action Step 3: Design Prototype Dashboards Following Parmenter\u0026rsquo;s one-page methodology, create prototype dashboards for each major reporting area:\nExecutive summary: Overall organisational performance Operational dashboards: Department-specific metrics Project trackers: Status of major initiatives Cash performance: Treasury and working capital Use visualisation best practices as outlined by data visualisation expert Stephen Few in \u0026ldquo;Information Dashboard Design\u0026rdquo; (2006): minimise chart junk, use appropriate chart types, and ensure visual clarity.\nStep 4: Implement Exception Reporting Exception reporting—highlighting only significant variances—is central to Parmenter\u0026rsquo;s approach. Implement this by:\nEstablishing thresholds: Define what constitutes a significant variance Creating alerts: Develop visual indicators for exceptions Automating detection: Use technology to flag exceptions automatically As Parmenter emphasises, \u0026ldquo;Executives don\u0026rsquo;t need to know everything is fine—they need to know what requires their attention\u0026rdquo; (Parmenter, 2012).\nStep 5: Build Forecasting Elements Expand reporting from historical focus to include forward-looking elements. According to Steve Player and Steve Morlidge in \u0026ldquo;Future Ready\u0026rdquo; (2010), effective forecasts share these characteristics:\nRolling horizon: Always maintain same forecast distance Driver-based: Built on operational rather than financial drivers Scenario-enabled: Show range of possible outcomes Frequently updated: Refresh as new information becomes available Step 6: Create Delivery Cadence Implement appropriate reporting frequencies based on metric volatility and decision timelines. Parmenter suggests (2015):\nDaily: Critical operational metrics (production, sales, cash) Weekly: Performance indicators and project status Monthly: KRIs and financial summaries Quarterly: Strategic reviews and trend analysis Step 7: Continuously Improve Implement a formal feedback mechanism to refine reporting. As Parmenter notes, \u0026ldquo;The perfect dashboard is never created on the first attempt\u0026rdquo; (Parmenter, 2012).\nCase Study: Transforming Financial Reporting at a Retail Chain (Note: This case study is adapted from examples in Parmenter\u0026rsquo;s publications)\nA multi-location retail business struggled with information overload. Their monthly reporting package exceeded 45 pages and took 15 days to produce after month-end. Following Parmenter\u0026rsquo;s methodology:\nThey interviewed key decision-makers about information needs Created three one-page dashboards (executive, store operations, inventory) Implemented a 3-tier reporting system: Daily sales and inventory report (automated) Weekly performance dashboard (Tuesday delivery) Monthly executive summary (5 days after month-end) Results after implementation:\nReport preparation time decreased by 70% Executive engagement with financial information increased Decision response time improved from weeks to days Finance team redirected 25 hours per month to analysis Visual Design Principles for Financial Information Effective reporting isn\u0026rsquo;t just about content—it\u0026rsquo;s about presentation. Drawing from Edward Tufte\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Visual Display of Quantitative Information\u0026rdquo; (2001) and Stephen Few\u0026rsquo;s work, consider these design principles:\n1. Signal-to-Noise Ratio Eliminate what Tufte calls \u0026ldquo;chart junk\u0026rdquo;—decorative elements that don\u0026rsquo;t convey information:\nRemove grid lines unless essential Eliminate 3D effects Minimise text labels Use subtle background colours if any 2. Choose Appropriate Chart Types Different data requires different visualisation:\nTime series: Line charts Composition: Stacked bar charts Comparison: Side-by-side bars Correlation: Scatter plots Distribution: Histograms As Few notes, \u0026ldquo;The most common reporting mistake is using the wrong chart type for the data\u0026rdquo; (Few, 2006).\n3. Colour Psychology Use colour strategically:\nRed/yellow/green for performance indicators Blue for neutral information Consistent colour scheme across all reports No more than 5-7 colours total 4. Typography Matters Text elements should enhance readability:\nUse sans-serif fonts for screen display Establish clear hierarchy with font sizes Left-align most text Right-align numbers for comparison Technology Enablers for Lean Reporting Modern tools make Parmenter\u0026rsquo;s approach more achievable than ever:\nData Visualisation Software Tools like Tableau, Power BI, and Qlik provide:\nInteractive dashboards Data exploration capabilities Automated refreshes Exception highlighting Cloud-Based Analytics Cloud platforms offer advantages for distributed organisations:\nReal-time data access Mobile compatibility Collaborative analysis Centralised data governance Automated Data Integration ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tools reduce manual effort:\nScheduled data refreshes Cross-system integration Data cleansing automation Validation rules The Financial Controller\u0026rsquo;s Role in Reporting Transformation As financial controller, you are uniquely positioned to lead this transformation:\nChallenge the status quo: Question every report and every page Champion clarity: Advocate for users who need actionable information Bridge functions: Connect financial data to operational context Implement standards: Create reporting templates and guidelines Measure impact: Track how reporting changes influence decisions As Parmenter emphasises in \u0026ldquo;The Leading-Edge Manager\u0026rsquo;s Guide to Success\u0026rdquo; (2011), \u0026ldquo;The finance team should be the organisation\u0026rsquo;s leader in information presentation.\u0026rdquo;\nCommon Implementation Challenges Challenge 1: The \u0026ldquo;More Detail\u0026rdquo; Mindset Some stakeholders believe more information is always better.\nSolution: Parmenter suggests creating a \u0026ldquo;drill-down\u0026rdquo; capability—maintain the one-page summary but enable access to supporting detail on request.\nChallenge 2: \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ve Always Done It This Way\u0026rdquo; Organisational inertia often preserves ineffective reporting.\nSolution: Implement pilot projects with receptive stakeholders to demonstrate value, then use success stories to drive broader adoption.\nChallenge 3: System Limitations Legacy systems may not support modern visualisation.\nSolution: Begin with manual dashboard creation while building the case for technology investment based on time savings.\nChallenge 4: Skill Gaps Many finance teams lack data visualisation expertise.\nSolution: Invest in targeted training on visualisation principles and tools. As Parmenter notes, \u0026ldquo;This skill development pays immediate dividends\u0026rdquo; (Parmenter, 2012).\nSelf-Assessment: How Lean Is Your Reporting? Evaluate your current reporting against these criteria:\nHow many pages is your primary monthly financial report? What percentage of reported metrics are discussed in management meetings? How many days after period-end is your reporting available? What ratio of charts/graphics to tables exists in your reporting? Do your reports contain forward-looking elements? How often are reports actually referenced for decisions? The more your answers diverge from Parmenter\u0026rsquo;s recommendations, the greater your opportunity for improvement.\nAction Plan for Your Next 60 Days Based on Parmenter\u0026rsquo;s implementation methodology (2012), consider these immediate actions:\nSelect one critical report to transform as a pilot Interview three key users about their information needs Create a one-page prototype using the Parmenter structure Run parallel reporting (old and new) for one cycle Gather feedback and refine Document time savings and decision impact Extend approach to additional reports Conclusion: From Reporting to Insight The transformation from traditional reporting to Parmenter\u0026rsquo;s lean approach represents a fundamental shift in how finance delivers value. As he notes, \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not about producing less information—it\u0026rsquo;s about producing more insight\u0026rdquo; (Parmenter, 2015).\nBy embracing these principles, financial controllers can escape the reporting treadmill and position finance as a true source of decision support.\nIn our next post, we\u0026rsquo;ll explore how to move beyond traditional budgeting to implement rolling forecasts that increase organisational agility and improve resource allocation.\nReferences Bolten, R.

So far, we\u0026rsquo;ve installed Python, set up a development environment, and explored the basic syntax. Now it\u0026rsquo;s time to dive deeper into Python\u0026rsquo;s core data structures; the building blocks you\u0026rsquo;ll use to organise and manipulate data in your programs.\nIn this post, we\u0026rsquo;ll cover:\nLists: Python\u0026rsquo;s versatile sequence type Tuples: Immutable collections Dictionaries: Key-value mapping Sets: Unique value collections Choosing the right data structure I\u0026rsquo;ve found these data structures similar to concepts we use every day; lists are like columns in spreadsheets, dictionaries resemble lookup tables, and sets are perfect for tracking unique items like account codes.\n1. Lists Lists are ordered, mutable (changeable) collections that can contain items of different types. They\u0026rsquo;re perhaps the most commonly used data structure in Python.\n1.1 Creating Lists # Empty list empty_list = [] # List with initial values numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] mixed_data = [42, \u0026#34;hello\u0026#34;, True, 3.14] # Creating a list with the list() constructor chars = list(\u0026#34;Python\u0026#34;) # [\u0026#39;P\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;y\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;t\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;h\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;o\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;n\u0026#39;] # List of repeated values zeros = [0] * 5 # [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] 1.2 Accessing List Elements expenses = [1200, 450, 700, 95, 800] # Indexing (zero-based) first_expense = expenses[0] # 1200 last_expense = expenses[-1] # 800 # Slicing [start:end:step] - end index is exclusive first_three = expenses[0:3] # [1200, 450, 700] # Shorthand for starting from beginning first_three = expenses[:3] # [1200, 450, 700] # Shorthand for going to the end last_three = expenses[2:] # [700, 95, 800] # Negative indices count from the end last_two = expenses[-2:] # [95, 800] # Step value every_other = expenses[::2] # [1200, 700, 800] # Reverse a list reversed_expenses = expenses[::-1] # [800, 95, 700, 450, 1200] 1.3 Modifying Lists departments = [\u0026#34;Finance\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Marketing\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;IT\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Operations\u0026#34;] # Changing an element departments[1] = \u0026#34;Digital Marketing\u0026#34; # Adding elements departments.append(\u0026#34;HR\u0026#34;) # Adds to the end departments.insert(2, \u0026#34;Sales\u0026#34;) # Inserts at specific position # Removing elements departments.remove(\u0026#34;IT\u0026#34;) # Removes first occurrence of value popped_item = departments.pop() # Removes and returns last item popped_item = departments.pop(1) # Removes item at index 1 del departments[0] # Removes item at index 0 # Extending lists dept1 = [\u0026#34;Finance\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;HR\u0026#34;] dept2 = [\u0026#34;IT\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Operations\u0026#34;] dept1.extend(dept2) # dept1 now contains [\u0026#34;Finance\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;HR\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;IT\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Operations\u0026#34;] # Alternative: concatenation all_depts = dept1 + dept2 # Creates a new list # Finding elements position = departments.index(\u0026#34;HR\u0026#34;) # Raises ValueError if not found count = departments.count(\u0026#34;Finance\u0026#34;) # Counts occurrences of value 1.4 Useful List Operations numbers = [5, 2, 8, 1, 9] # Sorting numbers.sort() # Modifies the list in-place: [1, 2, 5, 8, 9] numbers.sort(reverse=True) # Descending order: [9, 8, 5, 2, 1] # If you don\u0026#39;t want to modify the original list sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers) # Returns a new sorted list # Reversing numbers.reverse() # Modifies the list in-place # Finding min/max minimum = min(numbers) maximum = max(numbers) # Sum of all elements total = sum(numbers) # Checking membership if 5 in numbers: print(\u0026#34;Found 5 in the list!\u0026#34;) # List comprehension (filtering and transforming) even_numbers = [x for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0] doubled = [x * 2 for x in numbers] 1.5 Nested Lists (2D Lists) # Quarterly expenses by department quarterly_expenses = [ [1200, 1500, 1100, 1800], # Finance [900, 950, 1025, 1150], # Marketing [850, 880, 920, 980] # IT ] # Accessing elements finance_q1 = quarterly_expenses[0][0] # 1200 marketing_q3 = quarterly_expenses[1][2] # 1025 # Looping through a 2D list for department in quarterly_expenses: for expense in department: print(expense, end=\u0026#34; \u0026#34;) print() # New line after each department 2. Tuples Tuples are similar to lists but are immutable (cannot be changed after creation). They\u0026rsquo;re commonly used for fixed collections of items.\n2.1 Creating Tuples # Empty tuple empty_tuple = () # Tuple with values coordinates = (10, 20) person = (\u0026#34;John\u0026#34;, 30, \u0026#34;Developer\u0026#34;) # Single-item tuple needs a comma single_item = (42,) # Without comma, it\u0026#39;s just a number in parentheses # Tuple packing (no parentheses needed) employee = \u0026#34;Jane\u0026#34;, 35, \u0026#34;Manager\u0026#34; # Creating with tuple() constructor letters = tuple(\u0026#34;abc\u0026#34;) # (\u0026#39;a\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;b\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;c\u0026#39;) 2.2 Accessing Tuple Elements coordinates = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50) # Similar to list indexing and slicing x = coordinates[0] # 10 last = coordinates[-1] # 50 subset = coordinates[1:4] # (20, 30, 40) 2.3 Tuple Operations employee = (\u0026#34;Jane\u0026#34;, 35, \u0026#34;Manager\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;HR\u0026#34;) # Count and index (like lists) age_pos = employee.index(35) count = employee.count(\u0026#34;Manager\u0026#34;) # Concatenation more_info = employee + (\u0026#34;Full-time\u0026#34;,) # Unpacking (very useful feature!) name, age, role, department = employee # Returning multiple values from a function (using tuple unpacking) def get_employee_stats(): return \u0026#34;Jane\u0026#34;, 35, 85000 name, age, salary = get_employee_stats() 2.4 Why Use Tuples?

Choosing the Right Data Structure Selecting the appropriate data structure can make your code more efficient and readable. Here\u0026rsquo;s a quick guide:\n5.1 When to Use Each Structure Use Lists when:\nYou need an ordered collection Items might need to be changed, added, or removed You need to store duplicate values You need to maintain insertion order Use Tuples when:\nYou have a fixed collection that shouldn\u0026rsquo;t change You want to return multiple values from a function You need elements that can serve as dictionary keys You want to ensure data integrity (immutability) Use Dictionaries when:\nYou need key-value mapping (lookups by key) You want fast lookups by a specific identifier You\u0026rsquo;re working with named attributes or properties You need to count occurrences of items Use Sets when:\nYou only care about unique values (no duplicates) You need to perform set operations (union, intersection) You want to quickly check if an item exists You\u0026rsquo;re removing duplicates from a collection 5.2 Performance Considerations Data structure choice affects performance. In general:\nLists: O(1) for append/pop at end, O(n) for insert/delete elsewhere Dictionaries: O(1) average for key lookups, insertions, and deletions Sets: O(1) average for membership testing, adding, removing # Example: Different approaches to counting word frequencies text = \u0026#34;to be or not to be that is the question\u0026#34; words = text.split() # Using a list (inefficient for counting) def count_with_list(words): counts = [] for word in words: found = False for item in counts: if item[0] == word: item[1] += 1 found = True break if not found: counts.append([word, 1]) return counts # Using a dictionary (efficient) def count_with_dict(words): counts = {} for word in words: if word in counts: counts[word] += 1 else: counts[word] = 1 return counts # Even more concise with collections.Counter from collections import Counter def count_with_counter(words): return Counter(words) # Compare results print(count_with_list(words)) print(count_with_dict(words)) print(dict(count_with_counter(words))) Practice Exercise: Financial Portfolio Tracker Let\u0026rsquo;s apply these data structures by creating a simple portfolio tracker:\ndef portfolio_tracker(): # Initialise portfolio using a dictionary of dictionaries portfolio = {} transactions = [] while True: print(\u0026#34;\\nPortfolio Tracker\u0026#34;) print(\u0026#34;1.

According to research by MIT Sloan Management Review, over 70% of executives believe their KPI systems don\u0026rsquo;t provide the strategic guidance they need (Neely \u0026amp; Bourne, 2020). This disconnect illustrates a fundamental problem: despite the prevalence of performance measurement systems, few organisations have metrics that genuinely drive improvement.\nAs David Parmenter explains in his seminal work \u0026ldquo;Key Performance Indicators: Developing, Implementing, and Using Winning KPIs\u0026rdquo; (2015), \u0026ldquo;Most organisations have been measuring the wrong things in the wrong way.\u0026rdquo; The result is what he calls \u0026ldquo;measurement dysfunction\u0026rdquo;—where metrics create perverse incentives, drive suboptimal behaviors, or simply fail to influence performance at all.\nParmenter\u0026rsquo;s Revolutionary KPI Framework What makes Parmenter\u0026rsquo;s approach revolutionary is his fundamental reclassification of performance measures. Unlike traditional approaches that treat all metrics as \u0026ldquo;KPIs,\u0026rdquo; Parmenter establishes a clear taxonomy:\nThe Four Types of Performance Measures Key Result Indicators (KRIs): High-level measures that tell the board how management has performed in a critical success factor or perspective Result Indicators (RIs): Tell you what you have done Performance Indicators (PIs): Tell you what to do Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Tell you what to do to increase performance dramatically This distinction is critical. As Parmenter notes, \u0026ldquo;The term KPI has been misused for years. Most measures that organisations proudly call KPIs are simply performance indicators at best, and many are simply result indicators masquerading as KPIs\u0026rdquo; (Parmenter, 2015).\nThe 10/80/10 Rule Based on this taxonomy, Parmenter advocates for what he calls the \u0026ldquo;10/80/10 rule\u0026rdquo; for organisational measures:\n10 Key Result Indicators (KRIs) for the board Up to 80 Result Indicators (RIs) and Performance Indicators (PIs) for management 10 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for staff This structured approach helps organisations focus on what truly matters while avoiding metric overload.\nThe Seven Characteristics of True KPIs According to Parmenter (2015), genuine KPIs share seven essential characteristics:\nNonfinancial measures: Not expressed in dollars, euros, yen, etc. Measured frequently: Daily or weekly (not monthly or quarterly) Acted upon by senior management: Leadership demonstrates their importance Clear understanding: All staff understand the measure and what corrective action is required Ties to responsibility: Can be tied to a specific individual or team Significant impact: Affects multiple critical success factors Positive impact: Encourages appropriate action with minimal unintended consequences When evaluating potential KPIs, these characteristics provide a valuable litmus test. If a measure fails on multiple criteria, it\u0026rsquo;s likely not a true KPI.\nCommon KPI Mistakes and How to Avoid Them Mistake 1: Focusing Almost Exclusively on Financial Metrics As noted by Robert Kaplan and David Norton in their Balanced Scorecard work (1996), \u0026ldquo;Financial metrics tell you the results of decisions you made 1-3 months ago.\u0026rdquo; They are inherently backward-looking.\nSolution: Parmenter recommends that true KPIs be nonfinancial measures that lead to financial results rather than simply measuring them. For example, measure customer satisfaction (leading indicator) rather than just revenue (lagging indicator).\nMistake 2: Measuring Too Infrequently According to Parmenter (2015), \u0026ldquo;A monthly measure can never be a KPI\u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s simply too old to be relevant for daily or weekly decision making.\u0026rdquo;\nSolution: Create systems that allow for more frequent measurement of critical metrics. With modern technology, many previously monthly metrics can now be tracked weekly or even daily.\nMistake 3: Setting Arbitrary Targets Many organisations set targets without understanding the measure\u0026rsquo;s natural performance range, resulting in what statistician W. Edwards Deming called \u0026ldquo;management by arbitrary numerical goal.\u0026rdquo;\nSolution: Use statistical process control principles to understand natural variation before setting targets. Parmenter suggests at least 15 data points to establish a baseline.\nMistake 4: Measuring Too Many Things A study by Bain \u0026amp; Company found that companies with effective KPI systems measured fewer things—they were focused on what truly mattered (Marr, 2012).\nSolution: Apply Parmenter\u0026rsquo;s 10/80/10 rule rigorously. For every new measure added, consider retiring an existing one.\nMistake 5: Failing to Distinguish Between Different Types of Measures As Parmenter says, \u0026ldquo;When you call everything a KPI, you end up with a dysfunctional measurement system\u0026rdquo; (Parmenter, 2015).\nSolution: Classify each measure using Parmenter\u0026rsquo;s taxonomy and manage each type appropriately.\nImplementing Parmenter\u0026rsquo;s KPI Methodology Step 1: Establish Critical Success Factors Before defining KPIs, organisations must identify their critical success factors (CSFs)—the limited number of areas where satisfactory results will ensure successful performance.\nParmenter recommends a structured workshop approach to identify 5-8 organisational CSFs. These become the foundation for all performance measures.\nStep 2: Develop Balanced Set of Performance Measures Building on Kaplan and Norton\u0026rsquo;s Balanced Scorecard (1996) and Parmenter\u0026rsquo;s refinements, measures should be balanced across six perspectives:\nCustomer satisfaction Financial performance Learning and growth Internal process efficiency Employee satisfaction Environment/community This balanced approach ensures no single aspect of performance is overemphasised at the expense of long-term sustainability.\nStep 3: Create Winning KPIs Parmenter recommends a bottom-up approach to KPI development:\nConvene a cross-functional team to identify potential measures Screen candidates against the seven KPI characteristics Test selected measures for a pilot period Refine based on feedback and observed impact Formalise the final KPI set Step 4: Develop Reporting Mechanisms For KPIs to drive performance, they must be reported effectively. Parmenter advocates for:\nDaily or weekly dashboard updates Exception-based reporting Visual displays that highlight trends Clear action thresholds As noted in his \u0026ldquo;Winning CFO\u0026rdquo; methodology (Parmenter, 2012), \u0026ldquo;The reporting of performance measures should focus on exception reporting rather than a complete snapshot of all measures.\u0026rdquo;\nStep 5: Facilitate Organisational Learning The final step is creating systems that encourage learning and improvement based on KPI results. This includes:\nRegular KPI review sessions Root cause analysis of significant variations Sharing of best practices across teams Continuous refinement of metrics Examples of Winning KPIs vs. Ineffective Measures To illustrate the difference between true KPIs and less effective measures, consider these examples from Parmenter\u0026rsquo;s work:\nTraditional Metrics vs. Winning KPIs Financial Perspective:\nTraditional: Monthly revenue (RI) Winning KPI: Late shipments to key customers (measured daily) Customer Perspective:\nTraditional: Quarterly customer satisfaction score (RI) Winning KPI: Number of customer complaints yesterday (KPI) Internal Process Perspective:\nTraditional: Monthly production efficiency (RI) Winning KPI: Production line downtime in last 24 hours (KPI) Employee Perspective:\nTraditional: Annual employee satisfaction (KRI) Winning KPI: Staff suggestions implemented in past week (KPI) Note how the winning KPIs are measured more frequently and are more actionable than their traditional counterparts.\nCase Study: Transforming KPIs at a Manufacturing Company (Note: This case study is adapted from examples in Parmenter\u0026rsquo;s publications)\nA mid-sized manufacturing company struggled with performance measurement despite having over 100 metrics tracked monthly. After implementing Parmenter\u0026rsquo;s methodology:\nThey identified six critical success factors through facilitated workshops Reduced their measurement set to 10 KRIs, 30 RIs/PIs, and 8 true KPIs Moved key measures from monthly to daily/weekly tracking Implemented visual management boards in each department Established regular performance dialogues around the KPIs Results after six months:\nOn-time delivery improved from 82% to 96% Customer complaints reduced by 45% Production efficiency increased by 15% Employee suggestions implemented rose from 5 to 35 per month The key insight: By measuring fewer things but measuring them correctly, the organisation gained far more insight and impact.\nCreating a KPI Implementation Roadmap Based on Parmenter\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Four Foundation Stones\u0026rdquo; methodology (2015), here\u0026rsquo;s a practical roadmap for implementing effective KPIs:\nFoundation Stone 1: Partnership with Staff, Unions, and Third Parties Form a cross-functional KPI team Involve frontline staff in measure selection Train managers in performance coaching Address concerns about measurement openly Foundation Stone 2: Transfer of Power to the Front Line Push decision rights to where information exists Create visual management systems Establish action thresholds and response protocols Empower teams to adjust processes based on KPI signals Foundation Stone 3: Measure and Report Only What Matters Apply the 10/80/10 rule rigorously Report different measures to different audiences Focus on exception reporting Use technology to automate data collection Foundation Stone 4: Source KPIs from Critical Success Factors Identify organisational CSFs Derive department and team CSFs Align KPIs to these critical factors Review alignment quarterly The Financial Controller\u0026rsquo;s Role in KPI Implementation As financial controller, you have a unique opportunity to lead KPI transformation:\nEducation: Help the organisation understand the difference between various types of measures Facilitation: Lead workshops to identify CSFs and potential KPIs Integration: Connect KPIs to planning and budgeting processes Analysis: Provide insight into relationships between lead and lag indicators Technology: Champion systems that enable more frequent measurement As Parmenter notes in \u0026ldquo;The Leading-Edge Manager\u0026rsquo;s Guide to Success\u0026rdquo; (2011), \u0026ldquo;The finance team is uniquely positioned to lead performance measurement initiatives given their analytical skills and organisation-wide perspective.\u0026rdquo;\nSelf-Assessment: How Effective Are Your Current KPIs? Evaluate your current measurement system against these criteria:\nDo your \u0026ldquo;KPIs\u0026rdquo; meet Parmenter\u0026rsquo;s seven characteristics? How frequently are your most important measures updated? Can frontline staff explain how they influence key measures? Do your measures balance across all six perspectives? How many levels of approval are required to act on a KPI signal? Do you distinguish between different types of measures? The more \u0026ldquo;no\u0026rdquo; answers you have, the greater opportunity for improvement using Parmenter\u0026rsquo;s methodology.\nNext Steps for Your KPI Journey Audit current measures: Classify existing metrics into KRIs, RIs, PIs, and KPIs Workshop CSFs: Identify 5-8 organisational critical success factors Pilot better frequency: Select 2-3 metrics to measure more frequently Visual management: Create simple dashboards for team performance dialogues Review and refine: Establish a quarterly KPI review process Conclusion Effective performance measurement isn\u0026rsquo;t about more metrics—it\u0026rsquo;s about better metrics. As Parmenter emphasises, \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s put time, effort, and money into measuring those activities that, when done well, will deliver the results we need\u0026rdquo; (Parmenter, 2015).\nBy applying his systematic approach to KPIs, financial controllers can lead a transformation from measurement as a bureaucratic exercise to measurement as a performance driver.\nIn our next post, we\u0026rsquo;ll explore how to translate these KPI principles into lean financial reporting that executives actually read and use for decision-making.\nReferences Kaplan, R.

In the first two posts, we installed Python and set up a proper development environment. Now it\u0026rsquo;s time to dive into the language itself. This post covers the fundamental building blocks of Python code that I\u0026rsquo;ve been learning.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll explore:\nVariables and basic data types Operators and expressions Control flow with conditionals and loops List comprehensions and lambdas Iterators and generators Error handling with try/except This post is a bit longer than the previous ones, but these fundamentals form the foundation of everything else in Python, so it\u0026rsquo;s worth taking the time to understand them.\n1. Variables and Basic Data Types Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don\u0026rsquo;t need to declare variable types explicitly. Coming from Excel formulas where everything just works, I found this quite intuitive.\n1.1 Variables and Assignment Variables in Python are created when you first assign a value to them:\n# Creating variables name = \u0026#34;Alex\u0026#34; age = 35 hourly_rate = 45.50 is_python_fun = True Variable names:\nCan contain letters, numbers, and underscores Cannot start with a number Are case-sensitive (rate and Rate are different variables) Should follow the snake_case convention (lowercase with underscores) 1.2 Basic Data Types Python has several built-in data types:\nNumbers # Integers (whole numbers) count = 10 negative_number = -5 # Floating-point (decimals) pi = 3.14159 discount_rate = 0.15 # Complex numbers complex_number = 3 + 4j # Not often used in business applications Strings # Text enclosed in quotes (single or double) first_name = \u0026#34;John\u0026#34; last_name = \u0026#39;Doe\u0026#39; # Multi-line strings use triple quotes address = \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;123 Main Street Anytown, CA 12345\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; # String concatenation full_name = first_name + \u0026#34; \u0026#34; + last_name # \u0026#34;John Doe\u0026#34; # f-strings (Python 3.6+) - my preferred way to format strings greeting = f\u0026#34;Hello, {first_name}! You are {age} years old.\u0026#34; Booleans # True or False values is_active = True has_paid = False # Boolean operations is_valid_customer = is_active and has_paid # False can_contact = is_active or has_paid # True is_not_active = not is_active # False None Type # Represents absence of value (similar to NULL in databases) result = None 1.3 Type Conversion Python can convert between types:\n# String to number age_str = \u0026#34;35\u0026#34; age_num = int(age_str) # 35 as integer price_float = float(\u0026#34;45.50\u0026#34;) # 45.5 as float # Number to string count_str = str(10) # \u0026#34;10\u0026#34; as string # Check type of a variable print(type(age_num)) # \u0026lt;class \u0026#39;int\u0026#39;\u0026gt; 2. Operators and Expressions Python supports various operators for calculations and comparisons.\n2.1 Arithmetic Operators a = 10 b = 3 addition = a + b # 13 subtraction = a - b # 7 multiplication = a * b # 30 division = a / b # 3.3333... (always returns float) floor_division = a // b # 3 (integer division, rounds down) modulus = a % b # 1 (remainder of division) exponent = a ** b # 1000 (10 raised to power of 3) 2.2 Comparison Operators a = 10 b = 3 equal = a == b # False not_equal = a != b # True greater_than = a \u0026gt; b # True less_than = a \u0026lt; b # False greater_or_equal = a \u0026gt;= b # True less_or_equal = a \u0026lt;= b # False 2.3 Assignment Operators # Simple assignment x = 10 # Combined operators x += 5 # Same as x = x + 5 (x becomes 15) x -= 3 # Same as x = x - 3 (x becomes 12) x *= 2 # Same as x = x * 2 (x becomes 24) x /= 4 # Same as x = x / 4 (x becomes 6.0) 3. Control Flow Control flow determines the order in which code executes based on conditions and loops.\n3.1 Conditional Statements (if/elif/else) Python uses indentation (whitespace) to define code blocks:\nage = 25 if age \u0026lt; 18: print(\u0026#34;Minor\u0026#34;) elif age \u0026lt; 65: print(\u0026#34;Adult\u0026#34;) else: print(\u0026#34;Senior\u0026#34;) Multiple conditions:\nincome = 75000 years_employed = 3 if income \u0026gt; 50000 and years_employed \u0026gt;= 2: print(\u0026#34;Loan approved\u0026#34;) elif income \u0026gt; 30000 or years_employed \u0026gt;= 5: print(\u0026#34;Further review needed\u0026#34;) else: print(\u0026#34;Loan denied\u0026#34;) 3.2 Loops For Loops For loops iterate over sequences (lists, strings, etc.):\n# Loop through a list expenses = [1200, 450, 700, 95] total = 0 for expense in expenses: total += expense print(f\u0026#34;Total expenses: ${total}\u0026#34;) # Total expenses: $2445 # Loop with a range for i in range(5): # 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 print(i) # Loop with index and value using enumerate for index, value in enumerate(expenses): print(f\u0026#34;Expense {index+1}: ${value}\u0026#34;) While Loops While loops execute as long as a condition is true:\ncount = 0 while count \u0026lt; 5: print(count) count += 1 # Don\u0026#39;t forget this or you\u0026#39;ll create an infinite loop! # Break and continue number = 0 while True: # Infinite loop number += 1 if number == 3: continue # Skip the rest of this iteration if number == 6: break # Exit the loop entirely print(number) # Prints 1, 2, 4, 5 4. List Comprehensions and Lambdas These are more advanced features that make Python code concise and expressive.\n4.1 List Comprehensions List comprehensions provide a compact way to create lists:\n# Traditional way numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] squares = [] for n in numbers: squares.append(n * n) print(squares) # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25] # With list comprehension squares = [n * n for n in numbers] print(squares) # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25] # With conditional filtering even_squares = [n * n for n in numbers if n % 2 == 0] print(even_squares) # [4, 16] 4.2 Dictionary and Set Comprehensions Similar syntax works for dictionaries and sets:\n# Dictionary comprehension number_to_square = {n: n * n for n in numbers} print(number_to_square) # {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25} # Set comprehension (eliminates duplicates) values = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5] unique_values = {v for v in values} print(unique_values) # {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} 4.3 Lambda Functions Lambdas are small anonymous functions defined with the lambda keyword:\n# Traditional function def add(a, b): return a + b # Equivalent lambda function add_lambda = lambda a, b: a + b print(add(2, 3)) # 5 print(add_lambda(2, 3)) # 5 Lambdas are often used with functions like map(), filter(), and sorted():\n# Map applies a function to each item in an iterable numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] squared = list(map(lambda x: x * x, numbers)) print(squared) # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25] # Filter creates a list of elements for which a function returns True even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers)) print(even_numbers) # [2, 4] # Sorted with a custom key function employees = [ {\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Alice\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;salary\u0026#34;: 60000}, {\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Bob\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;salary\u0026#34;: 50000}, {\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Charlie\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;salary\u0026#34;: 75000} ] sorted_by_salary = sorted(employees, key=lambda emp: emp[\u0026#34;salary\u0026#34;]) print(sorted_by_salary) # Sorts employees by salary 5. Iterators and Generators These features help process data efficiently, especially when working with large datasets.\n5.1 Iterators An iterator is an object that can be iterated (looped) over. Python\u0026rsquo;s for loops work with iterators:\n# Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets are all iterable numbers = [1, 2, 3] for num in numbers: # numbers.__iter__() is called implicitly print(num) You can create your own iterator:\n# Manual iteration with iter() and next() numbers = [1, 2, 3] iterator = iter(numbers) print(next(iterator)) # 1 print(next(iterator)) # 2 print(next(iterator)) # 3 # print(next(iterator)) # Would raise StopIteration exception 5.2 Generators Generators are functions that return an iterator using the yield keyword:\ndef count_up_to(max): count = 1 while count \u0026lt;= max: yield count count += 1 # Using the generator counter = count_up_to(5) print(next(counter)) # 1 print(next(counter)) # 2 # Or in a loop for number in count_up_to(3): print(number) # Prints 1, 2, 3 Generators are memory-efficient because they generate values on-demand rather than storing the entire sequence in memory. This is especially useful for large datasets.\n6. Error Handling with try/except Python uses exceptions to handle errors gracefully:\n# Basic try/except try: result = 10 / 0 # Division by zero raises an exception print(result) except ZeroDivisionError: print(\u0026#34;Cannot divide by zero!\u0026#34;) # Handling multiple exception types try: number = int(input(\u0026#34;Enter a number: \u0026#34;)) result = 100 / number print(result) except ValueError: print(\u0026#34;That\u0026#39;s not a valid number!\u0026#34;) except ZeroDivisionError: print(\u0026#34;Cannot divide by zero!\u0026#34;) # Try/except/else/finally try: file = open(\u0026#34;data.txt\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;r\u0026#34;) content = file.read() except FileNotFoundError: print(\u0026#34;File not found!\u0026#34;) else: # Runs if no exception occurred print(f\u0026#34;File content: {content}\u0026#34;) finally: # Always runs, regardless of exception if \u0026#39;file\u0026#39; in locals() and not file.closed: file.close() print(\u0026#34;File closed!\u0026#34;) Practice Exercise: Financial Calculator Let\u0026rsquo;s apply what we\u0026rsquo;ve learned to build a simple financial calculator:\nCreate a program that:\nAsks the user for their monthly income and expenses Calculates their monthly savings Projects savings over time with compound interest Handles invalid inputs gracefully with try/except Here\u0026rsquo;s a starter template:\ndef calculate_savings_projection(monthly_savings, annual_interest_rate, years): # Convert annual interest rate to monthly and decimal monthly_rate = annual_interest_rate / 100 / 12 months = years * 12 # Project savings total = 0 for month in range(1, months + 1): total = total + monthly_savings # Add monthly contribution interest = total * monthly_rate # Calculate interest total = total + interest # Add interest to total # Print yearly totals if month % 12 == 0: print(f\u0026#34;Year {month // 12}: ${total:.2f}\u0026#34;) return total try: income = float(input(\u0026#34;Enter your monthly income: $\u0026#34;)) expenses = float(input(\u0026#34;Enter your monthly expenses: $\u0026#34;)) monthly_savings = income - expenses if monthly_savings \u0026lt;= 0: print(\u0026#34;Your expenses exceed your income. No savings to project.\u0026#34;) else: interest_rate = float(input(\u0026#34;Enter annual interest rate (%): \u0026#34;)) years = int(input(\u0026#34;Enter number of years to project: \u0026#34;)) print(f\u0026#34;\\nMonthly savings: ${monthly_savings:.2f}\u0026#34;) print(f\u0026#34;Projecting growth over {years} years at {interest_rate}% annual interest:\u0026#34;) final_amount = calculate_savings_projection(monthly_savings, interest_rate, years) print(f\u0026#34;\\nFinal savings after {years} years: ${final_amount:.2f}\u0026#34;) except ValueError: print(\u0026#34;Please enter valid numbers only.\u0026#34;) What\u0026rsquo;s Next? Now that we\u0026rsquo;ve covered the syntax fundamentals, the next post will dive into Python\u0026rsquo;s core data structures in more detail.

This perception, while increasingly outdated, persists in many organisations.\nAs David Parmenter notes in his book \u0026ldquo;The Leading-Edge Manager\u0026rsquo;s Guide to Success\u0026rdquo; (2011), \u0026ldquo;Yesterday\u0026rsquo;s finance team was renowned for producing financial information that was too late, too detailed, and not focused on what matters to the management team.\u0026rdquo; This observation captures the fundamental challenge that modern financial controllers must overcome.\nThe new reality demands something entirely different:\nBean Counter (Traditional Model):\nFocus on transactions and compliance \u0026ldquo;Scorekeeping\u0026rdquo; mentality Historical reporting Technical accounting expertise Risk aversion and control orientation Process standardisation Business Partner (Modern Model):\nFocus on strategy and value creation Forward-looking guidance Predictive analysis and scenario planning Broad business acumen Balanced risk management perspective Innovation and continuous improvement Parmenter\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Winning Finance Team\u0026rdquo; Concept David Parmenter has been at the forefront of redefining the finance function\u0026rsquo;s role. In his \u0026ldquo;Winning CFO\u0026rdquo; methodology (Parmenter, 2012), he emphasises that truly effective finance teams operate as partners to the business rather than merely as providers of financial information.\nAccording to Parmenter, the winning finance team:\nSells the vision: Communicates the purpose behind finance initiatives Creates strategic alliances: Builds relationships across the organisation Maintains what\u0026rsquo;s working: Preserves effective practices while innovating Understands the customers: Knows what internal customers genuinely need Delivers \u0026ldquo;wow\u0026rdquo; projects: Implements high-impact initiatives Uses leading-edge methodologies: Employs best practices in performance management This framework provides a valuable roadmap for controllers seeking to reposition themselves from technical specialists to strategic partners.\nThe Four Faces of Finance Leadership Building on Parmenter\u0026rsquo;s work, Deloitte\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Four Faces of the CFO\u0026rdquo; framework (Deloitte, 2021) offers another useful perspective on this evolution. While originally focused on CFO roles, it applies equally to controllers and finance managers:\nSteward: Preserving assets, ensuring compliance Operator: Running efficient finance operations Strategist: Helping to shape overall strategy and direction Catalyst: Instilling a financial approach and mindset across the organisation Traditional controllers excel at the first two faces but must develop competencies in the latter two to truly function as business partners. As noted in Deloitte\u0026rsquo;s research, high-performing finance teams spend approximately 60% of their time on strategist and catalyst activities, compared to just 30% for average teams.\nPractical Steps for Transformation 1. Develop Business Acumen Business partnership requires understanding the business beyond its financial statements. As Parmenter emphasises in \u0026ldquo;Winning CFO\u0026rdquo; (2012), finance professionals need to \u0026ldquo;walk in the shoes\u0026rdquo; of operational colleagues:\nSchedule regular operational visits: Spend time understanding how different departments function Learn the industry language: Master the terminology and metrics specific to your industry Study the value chain: Understand how your company creates and delivers value Know your customers: Gain insights into customer needs and behaviors 2. Build Relationships Intentionally According to McKinsey\u0026rsquo;s research on finance excellence (McKinsey \u0026amp; Company, 2020), relationship-building is a critical yet often overlooked aspect of finance transformation:\nMap your stakeholders: Identify key decision-makers and their priorities Establish regular touchpoints: Create structured opportunities for interaction Ask better questions: Focus on understanding business needs rather than just financial results Speak their language: Translate financial concepts into business terms 3. Shift from Reporting to Analysis Parmenter advocates for a fundamental shift in how finance teams allocate their time. In \u0026ldquo;Key Performance Indicators\u0026rdquo; (Parmenter, 2015), he suggests:\nReduce time spent on data compilation by 40-60% Increase time spent on analysis by 30-50% Focus reporting on exceptions and insights rather than comprehensive data This shift requires:\nAutomating routine processes: Implementing technology solutions for data collection and basic reporting Standardising analytics: Creating reusable frameworks for business analysis Developing forward-looking metrics: Building predictive models rather than just historical views 4. Master the Art of Communication Business partners must communicate effectively. As Parmenter emphasises in his \u0026ldquo;Winning KPIs\u0026rdquo; methodology (2015), numbers without context rarely drive action:\nKnow your audience: Tailor information to the recipient\u0026rsquo;s needs and preferences Focus on implications: Explain the \u0026ldquo;so what\u0026rdquo; behind the numbers Use visualisation effectively: Apply principles of data visualisation Tell stories with data: Frame information within relevant business narratives Research by the Corporate Executive Board (now Gartner) found that finance teams who effectively communicate insights are 24% more likely to be viewed as strategic partners.\n5. Lead Change Initiatives To be seen as a business partner, finance must actively drive improvement. In \u0026ldquo;The Leading-Edge Manager\u0026rsquo;s Guide to Success,\u0026rdquo; Parmenter (2011) emphasises the importance of leading \u0026ldquo;breakthrough projects\u0026rdquo;:\nIdentify high-impact opportunities: Focus on initiatives with significant ROI Apply project management discipline: Demonstrate structured implementation capabilities Measure and communicate results: Quantify the value created Build on successes: Use completed projects as springboards for further initiatives Common Challenges in Making the Transition Challenge 1: The Technical Comfort Zone Many finance professionals have built their careers on technical excellence. Stepping outside this comfort zone can be daunting.\nSolution: Start small by volunteering for cross-functional projects that allow you to apply financial expertise in a broader context while gradually developing new skills.\nChallenge 2: Credibility Gaps Operational colleagues may be skeptical of finance\u0026rsquo;s ability to add value beyond compliance and control.\nSolution: As Parmenter suggests in \u0026ldquo;Winning CFO\u0026rdquo; (2012), begin with \u0026ldquo;quick wins\u0026rdquo; that demonstrate tangible value to build credibility for larger initiatives.\nChallenge 3: Time Constraints The daily pressures of financial operations can make it difficult to allocate time to strategic activities.\nSolution: Apply Parmenter\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;fast close\u0026rdquo; methodology (2013) to streamline month-end processes, freeing up capacity for business partnering.\nChallenge 4: Skill Gaps Business partnering requires capabilities that may not have been developed through traditional accounting training.\nSolution: Invest in targeted development in areas like strategic thinking, influence skills, and business acumen through both formal and experiential learning.\nMeasuring Your Progress How do you know if you\u0026rsquo;re successfully making the transition from bean counter to business partner? Consider these metrics suggested by Parmenter and others:\nTime allocation: % of finance team time spent on analysis vs. transaction processing Meeting invitations: Frequency of inclusion in strategic business discussions Decision impact: % of business decisions influenced by finance input Satisfaction surveys: Ratings from internal customers on finance\u0026rsquo;s value contribution Initiative leadership: # of business improvement projects led by finance Case Study: Finance Transformation at Company XYZ (Note: This is an illustrative example based on Parmenter\u0026rsquo;s work with clients as described in his publications)\nA mid-sized manufacturing company found its finance team trapped in the traditional model—spending 80% of their time on transaction processing and reporting, with minimal time for analysis or business support.\nFollowing Parmenter\u0026rsquo;s methodology, they implemented several key changes:\nAutomated standard reports using dashboard technology Restructured the team to create dedicated business partner roles Implemented a fast close process to complete month-end in 3 days Established regular business review sessions with operational leaders The results were transformative:\nTime spent on reporting decreased from 60% to 30% Analysis time increased from 15% to 45% Internal customer satisfaction with finance increased by 40% Finance-led initiatives delivered $1.2M in cost savings Self-Assessment: Where Are You on the Journey? To assess your current position on the bean counter to business partner spectrum, consider these questions:\nDo operational colleagues proactively seek your input on business decisions? Can you clearly articulate your company\u0026rsquo;s competitive strategy and market position? Have you led or substantially contributed to a business improvement initiative in the past six months? Do your reports focus more on insights and recommendations than data compilation? How often do you spend time in operational areas of the business? Can you explain complex financial concepts in non-technical language? The more \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo; answers you have, the further along you are in your transformation journey.\nAction Items for Your First 90 Days Based on Parmenter\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;first 100 days\u0026rdquo; methodology for finance leaders (Parmenter, 2012), consider these priority actions:\nConduct a stakeholder analysis: Identify key business leaders and their priorities Schedule operational visits: Spend time understanding the business firsthand Review your reporting package: Identify opportunities for streamlining and insight enhancement Find a quick win: Identify and implement one high-visibility improvement Build your knowledge base: Dedicate time to understanding your industry and competitive landscape Conclusion: A Mindset Shift The transformation from bean counter to business partner is fundamentally about mindset. As Parmenter emphasises throughout his work, it requires shifting from:\nAccuracy to relevance Compliance to performance Past to future Data to insights Control to enablement Process to outcomes This journey won\u0026rsquo;t happen overnight, but with deliberate focus and consistent action, you can reposition yourself and your team as valued strategic partners rather than mere financial technicians.\nIn our next post, we\u0026rsquo;ll explore Parmenter\u0026rsquo;s approach to Key Performance Indicators and how to develop metrics that actually drive performance rather than just measure it.\nReferences Deloitte.

Fast forward to today, and the role of a finance manager has evolved into something far more dynamic and strategic than I could have anticipated. This transformation mirrors a broader shift in the finance profession—particularly for those in controller and finance manager positions.\nThe days of the financial controller as a mere \u0026ldquo;bean counter\u0026rdquo; are long behind us. Today\u0026rsquo;s financial controllers are expected to be strategic partners, data analysts, risk managers, technology implementers, and forward-looking advisors. We\u0026rsquo;re tasked not just with reporting what happened financially, but with providing insights that shape what will happen next.\nWhy This Blog Series? This blog series represents my commitment to \u0026ldquo;learning in public\u0026rdquo; as I navigate this evolving landscape. As a finance manager with a strong accounting foundation, I\u0026rsquo;m documenting my journey of growth and discovery—synthesizing insights from thought leaders in the field, particularly David Parmenter, whose practical approaches to finance leadership have been revolutionary.\nThrough these posts, I aim to:\nDistill key concepts from leading finance thinkers into practical, actionable advice Share implementation strategies that work in real-world scenarios Build a community of forward-thinking finance professionals Document my own transformation from technical accountant to strategic finance partner Who is David Parmenter? For those unfamiliar with his work, David Parmenter is a globally recognised expert in financial leadership, performance measures, and management reporting. His methodologies have transformed finance departments around the world, particularly through concepts like:\nDistinguishing between Key Result Indicators (KRIs) and genuine Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Implementing \u0026ldquo;winning KPIs\u0026rdquo; that actually drive organisational performance Creating lean, focused reporting that executives actually use for decision-making Transitioning from traditional budgeting to rolling forecasts Developing \u0026ldquo;fast close\u0026rdquo; procedures that dramatically reduce month-end processing time Building finance teams that function as true business partners Throughout this series, I\u0026rsquo;ll be drawing extensively on Parmenter\u0026rsquo;s frameworks while also incorporating insights from other thought leaders such as Jeremy Hope, Robin Fraser, Robert Kaplan, and Jack Stack.\nThe Transformation of the Financial Controller Role The evolving expectations of financial controllers reflect broader changes in business:\nTraditional Controller Focus:\nHistorical reporting Transaction processing Compliance and control Budget variances Cost accounting Modern Controller Focus:\nStrategic decision support Business partnership Performance optimisation Predictive analytics Technology enablement Creating sustainable value According to a recent survey by McKinsey, companies with strong finance-business partnerships are 20% more likely to achieve breakthrough performance. Yet many finance departments struggle to make this transition effectively.\nWhat to Expect in This Series Over the coming weeks, I\u0026rsquo;ll be exploring:\nThe strategic partner mindset and how to develop it Performance measurement systems that drive meaningful action Reporting transformation to deliver insights, not just information Beyond budgeting methodologies that increase agility Process improvements that free up time for value-added work Building high-performance finance teams Leading business transformation from the finance office Technology enablement for modern finance functions Each post will combine theoretical frameworks with practical implementation steps, challenges you might face, and metrics to track your progress.\nMy Learning Approach As I mentioned, this series is part of my \u0026ldquo;learn in public\u0026rdquo; journey. I\u0026rsquo;m not presenting myself as the ultimate authority—rather, I\u0026rsquo;m sharing what I\u0026rsquo;m discovering as I implement these concepts in my own role.\nI invite you to join me in this learning journey:\nShare your experiences in the comments Suggest additional resources or experts I should explore Challenge assumptions and offer alternative perspectives Propose topics for deeper exploration Getting Started: Self-Assessment Before diving into the specific methodologies in future posts, I encourage you to consider where your finance function currently stands:\nWhat percentage of your finance team\u0026rsquo;s time is spent on transaction processing versus business partnering? Do your financial reports drive action, or do they simply communicate what happened? How quickly can you close your books at month-end? Does your budgeting process add value proportionate to the time invested? Are your finance team members viewed as strategic advisors by operational colleagues?

Now what? In this guide, I\u0026rsquo;ll walk you through everything I\u0026rsquo;ve learned about making VS Code work for you, especially if you\u0026rsquo;re just getting started.\nWhy I Chose VS Code Before getting into the details, let me share why I chose VS Code:\nLightweight enough to open quickly Powerful enough for serious development Enormous extension ecosystem Regular updates with new features Works consistently across Windows, Mac, and Linux Getting Started: The VS Code Interface When you first open VS Code, here\u0026rsquo;s what you\u0026rsquo;re looking at:\nActivity Bar: The vertical bar on the far left with icons for different views Side Bar: Shows different panels like Explorer, Search, and Extensions Editor Area: Where you edit your files (can be split!) Status Bar: At the bottom, showing helpful information Panel: Terminal, problems, output (toggle with Ctrl+J or Cmd+J on Mac) ![VS Code Interface Areas]\nDon\u0026rsquo;t worry if it feels like a lot—we\u0026rsquo;ll break it down piece by piece.\nEssential Keyboard Shortcuts I Use Daily Learning keyboard shortcuts dramatically improved my productivity. Here are the ones I use constantly:\nShortcut (Windows/Linux) Shortcut (Mac) Action Ctrl+P Cmd+P Quick Open file Ctrl+Shift+P Cmd+Shift+P Command Palette Ctrl+, Cmd+, User Settings Ctrl+B Cmd+B Toggle sidebar Ctrl+J Cmd+J Toggle panel (terminal) Ctrl+\\ Cmd+\\ Split editor Ctrl+Tab Cmd+Tab Switch between open files Alt+Up/Down Option+Up/Down Move line up/down Ctrl+D Cmd+D Add selection to next find match Ctrl+Space Cmd+Space Trigger suggestion F12 F12 Go to definition Alt+F12 Option+F12 Peek definition Ctrl+Shift+F Cmd+Shift+F Search across files Ctrl+~ Cmd+~ Open integrated terminal I found that learning just 3-4 shortcuts a week was manageable and made a huge difference over time.\nThe Command Palette: Your Best Friend If I could highlight just one feature, it would be the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac). It gives you access to virtually every command in VS Code.\nTry this right now:\nPress Ctrl+Shift+P (or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac) Type \u0026ldquo;theme\u0026rdquo; Select \u0026ldquo;Color Theme\u0026rdquo; Browse through available themes I use the Command Palette to:\nRun specific commands Change settings Open user/workspace settings Toggle features on/off Format documents And so much more! Pro tip: Commands prefixed with \u0026gt; are VS Code commands, while others are for navigating files or settings.\nFile Navigation That Saved Me Hours Finding files quickly is essential for productivity. Here\u0026rsquo;s how I navigate efficiently:\nQuick Open (Ctrl+P / Cmd+P) Just start typing the filename—it uses fuzzy matching so you don\u0026rsquo;t need the exact name.\nNavigating Inside Files Ctrl+G (Cmd+G on Mac): Go to specific line number Ctrl+Shift+O (Cmd+Shift+O): Navigate to symbols in the current file F12: Jump to definition Alt+F12: Peek definition (shows definition in a popup) Ctrl+Shift+\\: Jump to matching bracket Go Back/Forward Alt+Left/Right (Ctrl+- / Ctrl+Shift+- on Mac): Navigate back and forth through your position history Supercharging Your Editing These editing features have transformed how I write code:\nMulti-Cursor Editing This was a game-changer for me:\nAlt+Click (Option+Click on Mac): Add cursor at mouse position Ctrl+Alt+Up/Down (Cmd+Option+Up/Down): Add cursor above/below Ctrl+D (Cmd+D): Select next occurrence of current selection Ctrl+Shift+L (Cmd+Shift+L): Select all occurrences of current selection Text Manipulation Alt+Up/Down (Option+Up/Down): Move current line up/down Shift+Alt+Up/Down (Shift+Option+Up/Down): Copy line up/down Ctrl+Shift+K (Cmd+Shift+K): Delete line Ctrl+/ (Cmd+/): Toggle line comment Shift+Alt+A (Shift+Option+A): Toggle block comment Ctrl+Space (Cmd+Space): Trigger suggestions I use multi-cursor editing for bulk edits that would otherwise take forever.\nVS Code Extensions That Changed My Workflow Extensions are what make VS Code truly shine. Here are the ones I can\u0026rsquo;t live without:\nProductivity Boosters Prettier: Automatic code formatting ESLint: JavaScript linting GitLens: Enhanced Git capabilities Error Lens: Inline error display Auto Rename Tag: Automatically rename paired HTML/XML tags Path Intellisense: Autocompletes filenames Theme and Appearance Material Icon Theme: Better file icons One Dark Pro: My preferred theme Bracket Pair Colorizer 2: Color-codes matching brackets Language-Specific Extensions Python: Enhanced Python development Jupyter: Jupyter notebook support C/C++: For C language support markdownlint: Linting for markdown files Installing extensions is easy:\nClick the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar (or Ctrl+Shift+X) Search for the extension Click Install I recommend reviewing your extensions periodically and removing ones you don\u0026rsquo;t use to keep VS Code running smoothly.\nIntegrated Terminal: No More Window Switching The integrated terminal (Ctrl+`` or Cmd+`` on Mac) has saved me from constantly switching between windows:\nCreate multiple terminals by clicking the + button Split terminal views with the split button Switch between terminals with the dropdown Rename terminals for better organisation You can configure your default shell in settings:\nOpen Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) Type \u0026ldquo;settings\u0026rdquo; Select \u0026ldquo;Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)\u0026rdquo; Add your preferred terminal settings: \u0026#34;terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.windows\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;PowerShell\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.linux\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;bash\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.osx\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;zsh\u0026#34; Debugging Made Simple VS Code\u0026rsquo;s debugging capabilities eliminate the need for print statements everywhere:\nClick the Run and Debug icon in the Activity Bar Click \u0026ldquo;create a launch.json file\u0026rdquo; Select your environment Key debugging actions:\nF5: Start/Continue F9: Toggle breakpoint F10: Step over F11: Step into Shift+F11: Step out Ctrl+F5: Run without debugging The debug console lets you evaluate expressions and inspect variables in real-time, which was a revelation for me coming from print-based debugging.\nCustomising VS Code to Your Preferences VS Code\u0026rsquo;s customisation options are nearly endless. Here\u0026rsquo;s how I personalised mine:\nSettings.json My essential customisations:\n{ \u0026#34;editor.fontSize\u0026#34;: 14, \u0026#34;editor.fontFamily\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#39;Fira Code\u0026#39;, Consolas, \u0026#39;Courier New\u0026#39;, monospace\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;editor.fontLigatures\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;editor.formatOnSave\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;editor.defaultFormatter\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;esbenp.prettier-vscode\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;editor.minimap.enabled\u0026#34;: false, \u0026#34;editor.rulers\u0026#34;: [80, 120], \u0026#34;editor.wordWrap\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;on\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;workbench.colorTheme\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;One Dark Pro\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;workbench.iconTheme\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;material-icon-theme\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;terminal.integrated.fontSize\u0026#34;: 14, \u0026#34;files.autoSave\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;onFocusChange\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;explorer.confirmDelete\u0026#34;: false, \u0026#34;editor.bracketPairColorization.enabled\u0026#34;: true } You can access settings via:\nCtrl+, (Cmd+, on Mac) for the Settings UI Command Palette \u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)\u0026rdquo; for JSON editing Workspace Settings For project-specific settings, create a .vscode folder in your project with:\nsettings.json: Project-specific settings launch.json: Debugging configurations tasks.json: Task configurations extensions.json: Recommended extensions This allows you to have different settings for different projects.\nWorking with Git Integration VS Code\u0026rsquo;s built-in Git support eliminates the need for separate Git clients:\nThe Source Control panel shows changes clearly Inline change markers show what\u0026rsquo;s changed in each file Commit, push, pull, and branch directly from VS Code Resolve merge conflicts with a visual interface To get started with Git:\nOpen a folder that\u0026rsquo;s a Git repository Make some changes Click the Source Control icon in the Activity Bar Stage changes by clicking the + icon Enter a commit message and press Ctrl+Enter to commit Adding GitLens extends these capabilities even further with blame annotations, history browsing, and more.\nSnippets: Stop Typing the Same Code Over and Over Custom snippets have saved me countless hours of typing repetitive code:\nOpen Command Palette \u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;Snippets: Configure User Snippets\u0026rdquo; Select a language or create a global snippet file Add your snippets: \u0026#34;Print to console\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;prefix\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;log\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;body\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;console.log(\u0026#39;$1\u0026#39;);\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;$2\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Log output to console\u0026#34; } Now typing \u0026ldquo;log\u0026rdquo; and pressing Tab will insert console.log(''); with the cursor positioned between the quotes.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve created snippets for common patterns in each language I use.\nRemote Development: Life-Changing Feature Working on remote machines and containers transformed my development workflow:\nInstall the \u0026ldquo;Remote Development\u0026rdquo; extension pack Click the remote indicator in the bottom-left corner Select your remote connection type: SSH: Connect to remote servers WSL: Work in Windows Subsystem for Linux Containers: Work inside Docker containers This lets you use VS Code\u0026rsquo;s full power while code executes in a different environment—perfect for consistent development environments or working with remote servers.\nWorkspace Organisation for Large Projects For complex projects, I use these organisation features:\nMulti-root workspaces: Add multiple folders to a single workspace File explorer groups: Organise folders logically Workspace settings: Override settings for specific projects To create a multi-root workspace:\nOpen a folder Go to File \u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;Add Folder to Workspace\u0026rdquo; Save the workspace file (File \u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;Save Workspace As\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;) This approach is perfect for microservice architectures or when working with frontend and backend code simultaneously.\nLesser-Known Features Some features I discovered after using VS Code for a while:\nZen Mode: Ctrl+K Z (Cmd+K Z on Mac) for distraction-free coding Breadcrumbs: Navigate file structure at the top of editors Linked Editing: Edit HTML opening and closing tags simultaneously Emmet: Built-in HTML/CSS abbreviations (try typing div\u0026gt;ul\u0026gt;li*5 and pressing Tab) IntelliSense: Smart autocomplete that learns from your codebase Code Folding: Collapse sections with the arrows in the gutter Split Editor: Ctrl+\\ to edit files side by side Synchronising Settings Across Machines VS Code Settings Sync keeps my environment consistent across computers:\nClick the account icon in the bottom of the Activity Bar Turn on Settings Sync Select what to sync (settings, extensions, keybindings, etc.) Now your customisations follow you to any machine with VS Code installed.\nProblems I\u0026rsquo;ve Encountered (and How I Fixed Them) High Memory Usage Disable unused extensions Set \u0026quot;files.exclude\u0026quot; for large folders you don\u0026rsquo;t need indexed Use \u0026quot;search.exclude\u0026quot; to skip folders during searches Slow Performance Update VS Code to the latest version Try disabling extensions one by one to find the culprit Check for large files that might be slowing things down Language Server Issues Reinstall the language extension Check output panel for error messages Configure language server settings explicitly My Weekly VS Code Learning Habit I made the most progress with VS Code by adopting a simple habit: learn one new feature per week.\nOn a weekly basis:\nOpen the Command Palette Type \u0026ldquo;help\u0026rdquo; and select \u0026ldquo;Interactive Playground\u0026rdquo; Try one new feature or shortcut Practice it throughout the week This incremental approach helped me build confidence without feeling overwhelmed.\nConclusion: VS Code Changed How I Code When I first started using VS Code, I was just using it as a basic text editor. Now, it\u0026rsquo;s become an extension of my thinking process when coding. The features I\u0026rsquo;ve covered in this post have genuinely made me more productive and helped me write better code.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t feel like you need to learn everything at once! Start with the Command Palette and a few shortcuts, then gradually expand your knowledge. Before long, you\u0026rsquo;ll be navigating and editing code with an efficiency.\nResources for Going Further Official VS Code Documentation VS Code Tips and Tricks Keyboard Shortcut Reference Happy coding!\n","permalink":"https://michaelbrunger.com/vscode-mastery/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"vs-code-mastery-a-beginners-guide-to-being-productive\"\u003eVS Code Mastery: A Beginner\u0026rsquo;s Guide to Being Productive\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo you\u0026rsquo;ve downloaded VS Code and opened it up.

Last time, we got Python installed and ran our first code. Now it\u0026rsquo;s time to set up a proper coding environment. Working directly with .py files in Notepad gets tedious quickly, so let\u0026rsquo;s explore better options for writing Python code.\nIn this post, we\u0026rsquo;ll cover:\nThe difference between text editors and IDEs Popular options for Python development Setting up VS Code for Python (my personal choice) Key productivity features that will save you time Running and debugging Python code from your editor 1. Text Editors vs. IDEs: What\u0026rsquo;s the Difference? When I started learning Python, I was confused about whether to use a \u0026ldquo;text editor\u0026rdquo; or an \u0026ldquo;IDE\u0026rdquo;. Here\u0026rsquo;s the simple breakdown:\nText Editors:\nLightweight applications primarily designed for editing text Minimal features out of the box, but often extensible with plugins Faster startup times and lower system resource usage Examples: Notepad++, Sublime Text, Atom Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):\nComprehensive software packages with built-in tools for development Include code completion, debugging, testing, and version control features More resource-intensive but offer productivity benefits Examples: PyCharm, Visual Studio, Eclipse Modern text editors with plugins can blur the line between these categories. For instance, VS Code is technically a text editor but can function like an IDE with the right extensions.\n2. Popular Options for Python Development Here are some commonly used tools for Python programming:\nText Editors Notepad++ (Windows only)\nFree and lightweight Basic syntax highlighting for Python Minimal Python-specific features Good for quick edits but limited for larger projects Sublime Text\nCross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux) Fast and responsive with large files Package manager for extensions Free to evaluate, $99 license for continued use Atom\nOpen-source and free Highly customisable Good Git integration Can be slower with large projects IDEs Visual Studio Code (VS Code)\nFree, open-source, cross-platform Extensive extension library Lightweight but powerful Strong Python support through extensions My personal choice and what we\u0026rsquo;ll focus on in this post PyCharm\nPython-specific IDE by JetBrains Community (free) and Professional (paid) editions Comprehensive tools designed specifically for Python Steeper learning curve but powerful features Jupyter Notebooks\nInteractive coding environment Great for data analysis and visualisation Documents that combine code, output, and markdown text We\u0026rsquo;ll cover this in detail in a later post After trying several options, I settled on VS Code for its balance of performance and features. It\u0026rsquo;s lightweight enough to run smoothly on my machine but offers robust Python support.\n3. Setting Up VS Code for Python Development If you\u0026rsquo;re following along with me, let\u0026rsquo;s set up VS Code:\n3.1 Download and Install VS Code Go to https://code.visualstudio.com/ Download the installer for your operating system Run the installer with default options 3.2 Install Essential Python Extensions Launch VS Code Click the Extensions icon in the left sidebar (or press Ctrl+Shift+X) Search for and install these extensions: Python by Microsoft (essential) Pylance for improved language support Python Indent for automatic indentation 3.3 Configure Python Interpreter Open a Python file or create a new one (File \u0026gt; New File, then save with .py extension) Click on \u0026ldquo;Select Python Interpreter\u0026rdquo; in the bottom status bar Choose the Python installation you installed in Post 1 3.4 Set Up Code Formatting and Linting These tools help maintain code quality and consistent style:\nInstall the autopep8 formatter:\nOpen a terminal in VS Code (Terminal \u0026gt; New Terminal) Run: pip install autopep8 Configure formatter settings:\nPress Ctrl+Shift+P to open the command palette Type \u0026ldquo;Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)\u0026rdquo; Add these settings: \u0026#34;python.formatting.provider\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;autopep8\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;editor.formatOnSave\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;python.linting.enabled\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;python.linting.pylintEnabled\u0026#34;: true Install Pylint for code quality checking:\nIn the terminal, run: pip install pylint 4. Key Productivity Features Here are some features that have saved me hours of time while learning Python:\n4.1 Code Highlighting and IntelliSense VS Code automatically highlights Python syntax and provides IntelliSense (code completion):\nStart typing a Python keyword or function name VS Code shows suggestions as you type Press Tab to complete the suggestion Try it by typing pri and watching it suggest print().\n4.2 Code Snippets Snippets let you insert commonly used code patterns quickly:\nType if and press Tab VS Code inserts the if statement structure Fill in the condition and press Tab to move to the body Other useful snippets: for, def, class, try\n4.3 File Explorer and Multiple Files Having a file explorer helps manage projects with multiple files:\nUse File \u0026gt; Open Folder to open your project directory The left sidebar shows all files in that folder Create new files or folders directly in VS Code 4.4 Integrated Terminal No need to switch between VS Code and Command Prompt:\nPress Ctrl+` (backtick) or use Terminal \u0026gt; New Terminal Run Python code, install packages, or use Git commands 5. Running and Debugging Python Code 5.1 Running Python Files Method 1: Using the Play Button\nOpen a Python file Click the Play icon in the top-right corner Method 2: Using the Terminal\nOpen the integrated terminal (Ctrl+`) Run: python your_file.py 5.2 Introduction to Debugging Debugging helps you find and fix errors in your code:\nSet a breakpoint by clicking in the margin to the left of a line number (a red dot appears) Press F5 or click the Debug icon in the sidebar, then \u0026ldquo;Start Debugging\u0026rdquo; Your code runs until it hits the breakpoint, then pauses Examine variables in the \u0026ldquo;Variables\u0026rdquo; panel Use the debug toolbar to step through code line by line 5.3 Print-Driven Debugging vs. Using a Debugger When I first started coding, I relied heavily on print() statements to understand what was happening in my code:\ndef calculate_total(items): print(f\u0026#34;Items received: {items}\u0026#34;) # Debug print total = sum(items) print(f\u0026#34;Calculated total: {total}\u0026#34;) # Debug print return total While this works, using the debugger is more powerful:\nYou can inspect all variables without modifying code You can pause execution and examine the program state You don\u0026rsquo;t need to remove debug code when you\u0026rsquo;re done Practice Exercise Let\u0026rsquo;s put your new environment to use:\nCreate a new file called calculator.py in VS Code Write a simple function that takes two numbers and an operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide) and returns the result Add proper error handling (e.g., division by zero) Use print statements to test your function with various inputs Example solution (try it yourself first!):\ndef calculate(a, b, operation): if operation == \u0026#34;add\u0026#34;: return a + b elif operation == \u0026#34;subtract\u0026#34;: return a - b elif operation == \u0026#34;multiply\u0026#34;: return a * b elif operation == \u0026#34;divide\u0026#34;: if b == 0: return \u0026#34;Error: Division by zero\u0026#34; return a / b else: return \u0026#34;Error: Unknown operation\u0026#34; # Test the function print(calculate(10, 5, \u0026#34;add\u0026#34;)) # Should print 15 print(calculate(10, 5, \u0026#34;subtract\u0026#34;)) # Should print 5 print(calculate(10, 5, \u0026#34;multiply\u0026#34;)) # Should print 50 print(calculate(10, 5, \u0026#34;divide\u0026#34;)) # Should print 2.0 print(calculate(10, 0, \u0026#34;divide\u0026#34;)) # Should print error message Try using the debugger to step through this code and watch how the variables change.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s Next? Now that we have our Python development environment set up, we\u0026rsquo;re ready to dive deeper into Python syntax and language features. In the next post, we\u0026rsquo;ll explore variables, data types, control flow, and more fundamental Python concepts.\nStay tuned for Post 3: Python Syntax Fundamentals \u0026amp; Language Features!\nThis post is part of my journey learning Python.

Command Prompt (cmd.exe) is the traditional command-line interpreter for Windows operating systems. Dating back to MS-DOS, it allows users to interact with their computer by typing text commands rather than using a graphical user interface (GUI). While functional, Command Prompt has significant limitations:\nLimited scripting capabilities Inconsistent command syntax Text-only output format Limited access to Windows system components Why Use a Terminal? You might wonder why, in an age of sophisticated graphical interfaces, command-line terminals remain relevant. Here\u0026rsquo;s why terminals continue to be indispensable tools:\nEfficiency: Experienced users can execute complex operations faster than using GUI equivalents Automation: Commands can be scripted to automate repetitive tasks Remote administration: Servers and remote systems are often managed via command line Resource efficiency: Terminal operations typically use fewer system resources Precision: Commands provide explicit control over system operations Reproducibility: Command sequences can be saved, shared, and executed consistently Enter PowerShell: The Modern Command Line PowerShell represents Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s evolution of the command-line interface, designed to address the limitations of Command Prompt while providing a powerful environment for both casual users and system administrators.\nWhy PowerShell is Superior to Command Prompt PowerShell offers a number of advantages over traditional Command Prompt:\nObject-based pipeline: Commands pass entire objects rather than just text Consistent syntax: Commands follow a Verb-Noun pattern for intuitive learning Extensive .NET integration: Direct access to .NET framework capabilities Rich scripting language: Includes variables, functions, loops, conditions, and error handling Robust module system: Functionality can be extended through modules Remote management: Built-in remoting capabilities for managing distant systems Backward compatibility: Can still run most traditional cmd commands PowerShell has become Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s preferred command-line shell and scripting language, making it an essential skill for Windows administration and automation.\nGetting Started with PowerShell Opening PowerShell You can access PowerShell in several ways:\nSearch for \u0026ldquo;PowerShell\u0026rdquo; in the Windows start menu Right-click the Start button and select \u0026ldquo;Windows PowerShell\u0026rdquo; Press Win+X and select \u0026ldquo;Windows PowerShell\u0026rdquo; For the latest version, install \u0026ldquo;PowerShell 7\u0026rdquo; from the Microsoft Store or GitHub Understanding the PowerShell Interface When you open PowerShell, you\u0026rsquo;ll see a blue console window with a prompt that looks something like:\nPS C:\\Users\\YourUsername\u0026gt; The \u0026ldquo;PS\u0026rdquo; prefix indicates you\u0026rsquo;re in PowerShell, followed by your current directory location.\nEssential PowerShell Concepts Cmdlets: PowerShell Commands PowerShell commands are called \u0026ldquo;cmdlets\u0026rdquo; (pronounced \u0026ldquo;command-lets\u0026rdquo;) and follow a consistent Verb-Noun naming convention:\nGet-Process: Lists running processes Stop-Service: Stops a Windows service New-Item: Creates a new file or directory This standardised naming makes discovering and learning commands more intuitive.\nPipeline: Chaining Commands One of PowerShell\u0026rsquo;s most powerful features is the pipeline operator |, which passes the output of one command as input to another:\nGet-Process | Sort-Object -Property CPU -Descending | Select-Object -First 5 This command gets all processes, sorts them by CPU usage, and displays only the top 5.\nVariables Variables in PowerShell start with $:\n$name = \u0026#34;John\u0026#34; $age = 30 Write-Output \u0026#34;Hello, $name! You are $age years old.\u0026#34; Essential PowerShell Commands Navigation and File System Getting and Changing Location # Display current directory Get-Location # Alias: pwd # Change directory Set-Location C:\\Windows # Aliases: cd, chdir Listing Directory Contents # List items in current directory Get-ChildItem # Aliases: ls, dir # List with details Get-ChildItem -Force # Filter by extension Get-ChildItem -Filter *.txt Working with Files and Directories # Create a new directory New-Item -Path \u0026#34;C:\\temp\\NewFolder\u0026#34; -ItemType Directory # Create a new file New-Item -Path \u0026#34;C:\\temp\\test.txt\u0026#34; -ItemType File # Copy a file Copy-Item \u0026#34;C:\\temp\\test.txt\u0026#34; -Destination \u0026#34;C:\\temp\\test_backup.txt\u0026#34; # Move a file Move-Item \u0026#34;C:\\temp\\test.txt\u0026#34; -Destination \u0026#34;C:\\temp\\NewFolder\\test.txt\u0026#34; # Delete a file Remove-Item \u0026#34;C:\\temp\\test_backup.txt\u0026#34; # Read file content Get-Content \u0026#34;C:\\temp\\NewFolder\\test.txt\u0026#34; Navigating the File System (Useful Aliases) Below are a few useful aliases that I use to navigate the file system\nCommand/Alias Full Command Description Example ls Get-ChildItem Lists files and directories ls or ls -Force (to show hidden items) cd Set-Location Changes directory cd C:\\Users or cd ~ (home directory) pwd Get-Location Shows current directory path pwd mkdir New-Item -ItemType Directory Creates a new directory mkdir NewFolder pushd Push-Location Saves current location and moves to new location pushd C:\\Temp popd Pop-Location Returns to previously saved location popd cat Get-Content Displays file contents cat file.txt touch New-Item Creates a new file touch newfile.txt rm Remove-Item Deletes files or directories rm file.txt or rm -Recurse folder cp Copy-Item Copies files cp file.txt destination mv Move-Item Moves or renames files mv file.txt newname.txt System Information and Management Process Management # List all running processes Get-Process # Find specific processes Get-Process -Name \u0026#34;chrome\u0026#34; # Stop a process Stop-Process -Name \u0026#34;notepad\u0026#34; # Or by ID Stop-Process -Id 1234 Service Management # List all services Get-Service # Get specific service Get-Service -Name \u0026#34;wuauserv\u0026#34; # Windows Update service # Start a service Start-Service -Name \u0026#34;wuauserv\u0026#34; # Stop a service Stop-Service -Name \u0026#34;wuauserv\u0026#34; System Information # Basic system info Get-ComputerInfo # Operating system details Get-CimInstance Win32_OperatingSystem # Hardware information Get-CimInstance Win32_ComputerSystem # Disk information Get-PSDrive Networking Commands # Test network connection Test-NetConnection google.com # Ping a host Test-Connection google.com # Get IP configuration Get-NetIPConfiguration # Get DNS client server addresses Get-DnsClientServerAddress User and Security # Get current user $env:USERNAME # Get all local users Get-LocalUser # Create a new local user New-LocalUser -Name \u0026#34;NewUser\u0026#34; -Description \u0026#34;New user account\u0026#34; -NoPassword # Get user groups Get-LocalGroup Working with PowerShell Help PowerShell includes a comprehensive help system:\n# Get help on a cmdlet Get-Help Get-Process # Get detailed help with examples Get-Help Get-Process -Detailed Get-Help Get-Process -Examples # Update help files Update-Help PowerShell Scripting Basics Script Execution Policy By default, PowerShell restricts running scripts. To check your current policy:\nGet-ExecutionPolicy To change it (requires admin rights):\nSet-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned Common policies:\nRestricted: No scripts can run RemoteSigned: Local scripts can run; downloaded scripts need signing Unrestricted: All scripts can run (not recommended) Creating a Basic Script PowerShell scripts use the .ps1 extension. Create a file named hello.ps1:\n# hello.ps1 param( [string]$name = \u0026#34;World\u0026#34; ) Write-Output \u0026#34;Hello, $name!\u0026#34; Run it:\n.\\hello.ps1 .\\hello.ps1 -name \u0026#34;John\u0026#34; Basic Flow Control # If statement $age = 18 if ($age -ge 18) { Write-Output \u0026#34;Adult\u0026#34; } else { Write-Output \u0026#34;Minor\u0026#34; } # Foreach loop $fruits = @(\u0026#34;Apple\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Banana\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Cherry\u0026#34;) foreach ($fruit in $fruits) { Write-Output \u0026#34;I like $fruit\u0026#34; } # While loop $i = 1 while ($i -le 5) { Write-Output \u0026#34;Count: $i\u0026#34; $i++ } Advanced PowerShell Features Working with Objects PowerShell\u0026rsquo;s object pipeline is powerful. For example, get specific properties:\nGet-Process | Select-Object -Property Name, CPU, ID | Sort-Object -Property CPU -Descending Filtering Objects # Filter processes using CPU more than 10 Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.CPU -gt 10 } # Find large files Get-ChildItem -Path C:\\ -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Where-Object { $_.Length -gt 1GB } PowerShell Modules Modules extend PowerShell\u0026rsquo;s functionality:\n# List available modules Get-Module -ListAvailable # Import a module Import-Module ActiveDirectory # Find commands in a module Get-Command -Module ActiveDirectory Remote Management PowerShell can manage remote computers:\n# Create a remote session $session = New-PSSession -ComputerName Server01 # Run command on remote computer Invoke-Command -ComputerName Server01 -ScriptBlock { Get-Process } # Enter interactive session Enter-PSSession -ComputerName Server01 PowerShell in Modern Windows Environments PowerShell and Windows Management PowerShell is essential for managing:\nWindows Server environments Active Directory Azure resources Microsoft 365 services Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) PowerShell 7 PowerShell 7 is the latest major version, offering:\nCross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux) New operators and language features Improved performance Parallel processing with ForEach-Object -Parallel Ternary operator: condition ? true-result : false-result Conclusion PowerShell has evolved from a simple shell into a comprehensive management framework and scripting language. Learning PowerShell fundamentals will dramatically increase your productivity when working with Windows systems and Microsoft services.\nBy understanding these essential commands and concepts, you\u0026rsquo;re now equipped to:\nNavigate the file system efficiently Manage system processes and services Automate repetitive tasks Gather detailed system information Perform remote administration As you continue your PowerShell journey, remember that the built-in help system is your best friend.

Git allows you to track changes, collaborate with others, and maintain different versions of your project. This comprehensive guide will take you through everything you need to know to get started with Git on Windows.\nSetting Up Git Download Git and configure your identity:\ngit config --global user.name \u0026#34;Your Name\u0026#34; git config --global user.email \u0026#34;your.email@example.com\u0026#34; Run these commands once when you first install Git. They\u0026rsquo;ll associate your name and email with every commit you make.\nStarting a Project You have two options when starting with Git:\nCreate a New Repository mkdir my-project cd my-project git init This creates a new folder and initialises it as a Git repository.\nClone an Existing Repository git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git cd repository-name This downloads an existing project and its entire version history.\nThe Daily Git Workflow Here\u0026rsquo;s what a typical Git workflow looks like:\n1. Check Status (Run This Frequently) git status This shows what files have changed, what\u0026rsquo;s staged, and what\u0026rsquo;s not. Consider this your dashboard—check it often to understand what\u0026rsquo;s happening in your repository.\n2. Working with Changes Adding Files to the Staging Area\ngit add filename.txt # Add a specific file git add folder/ # Add an entire folder git add . # Add all changes Committing Your Changes\ngit commit -m \u0026#34;Clear description of your changes\u0026#34; Quick Commit for Already Tracked Files\ngit commit -am \u0026#34;Description of changes\u0026#34; 3. Working with Remote Repositories Push Your Changes to GitHub/GitLab/etc.\ngit push origin main Get the Latest Changes\ngit pull origin main See Remote Repository Information\ngit remote -v Add a Remote Repository\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository-name.git Branch Management Branches let you work on different features or fixes simultaneously.\nCreate and Switch to a New Branch\ngit checkout -b feature-name List All Branches\ngit branch # Local branches git branch -a # All branches including remote Merge a Branch\ngit checkout main # Switch to the target branch git merge feature-name Delete a Branch\ngit branch -d feature-name # Safe delete git branch -D feature-name # Force delete File Operations Discard Changes to a File\ngit checkout -- filename.txt Unstage a File\ngit restore --staged filename.txt Delete a File and Stage the Removal\ngit rm filename.txt Rename a File\ngit mv oldname.txt newname.txt Viewing History View Commit History\ngit log # Full history git log --oneline # Compact history git log --graph --oneline # Visual history View Changes in a Specific Commit\ngit show commit-hash See Changes Between Working Directory and Staging\ngit diff See Staged Changes\ngit diff --staged Fixing Mistakes Amend the Last Commit\ngit commit --amend -m \u0026#34;New commit message\u0026#34; Undo the Last Commit but Keep Changes\ngit reset HEAD~1 Completely Undo Last Commit and Changes\ngit reset --hard HEAD~1 Stash Changes Temporarily\ngit stash # Stash changes git stash pop # Retrieve stashed changes git stash list # List stashes Working with VS Code VS Code has excellent Git integration through its Source Control panel (Ctrl+Shift+G). You can:\nSee modified files Stage changes with a click Commit with a message Push/pull with buttons View diffs visually Resolve merge conflicts Real-World Workflows Adding New Code git status # See what\u0026#39;s changed git add . # Stage all changes git commit -m \u0026#34;Add login feature\u0026#34; # Commit changes git push origin main # Push to remote Fixing a Bug git checkout -b bugfix # Create a branch for your bugfix # Make your changes git add . # Stage changes git commit -m \u0026#34;Fix login validation bug\u0026#34; # Commit git checkout main # Switch back to main git pull origin main # Get latest changes git merge bugfix # Merge your bugfix git push origin main # Push to remote git branch -d bugfix # Delete the branch Deleting Files git rm obsolete-file.txt # Remove and stage deletion git commit -m \u0026#34;Remove obsolete file\u0026#34; # Commit deletion git push origin main # Push to remote Handling Merge Conflicts If a merge creates conflicts:\nOpen conflicted files in VS Code Look for conflict markers (\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;, =======, \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;) Edit to resolve conflicts Save files Run: git add . # Stage resolved files git commit # Commit the merge Git Terminology Glossary Understanding Git\u0026rsquo;s terminology is crucial for mastering the tool. Here\u0026rsquo;s a comprehensive glossary:\nCore Concepts Repository (Repo) - A storage location for your project that contains all files, folders, and the complete history of changes.\nWorking Directory - The files that you\u0026rsquo;re currently working with on your local machine.\nStaging Area (Index) - A middle ground between your working directory and repository where changes are prepared before committing.\nCommit - A snapshot of your repository at a specific point in time, including all tracked changes since the last commit.\nBranch - An independent line of development that allows you to work on features or fixes without affecting the main codebase.\nMain/Master - The default primary branch in your repository (traditionally called \u0026ldquo;master\u0026rdquo;, but \u0026ldquo;main\u0026rdquo; is now more common).\nHEAD - A pointer to the latest commit in your current branch; essentially \u0026ldquo;where you are now\u0026rdquo; in the repository\u0026rsquo;s history.\nClone - A complete copy of a repository, including all files and history.\nFork - A personal copy of someone else\u0026rsquo;s repository stored on your GitHub account.\nActions \u0026amp; Operations Stage - The act of preparing files for a commit by adding them to the staging area.\nCommit - The action of saving staged changes to the repository history.\nPush - Uploading commits from your local repository to a remote repository.\nPull - Downloading commits from a remote repository to your local repository and merging them.\nFetch - Downloading commits from a remote repository without automatically merging them.\nMerge - Combining changes from one branch into another.\nRebase - An alternative to merging that rewrites commit history by moving a branch to a new base commit.\nCheckout - Switching between branches or versions of files.\nStash - Temporarily storing uncommitted changes so you can work on something else.\nStorage Locations Local Repository - The Git repository stored on your computer.\nRemote Repository - A Git repository stored on a server or service (like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).\nOrigin - The default name Git gives to the remote repository from which you cloned.\nUpstream - The original repository that you forked from (commonly used in open-source projects).\nConnection \u0026amp; Synchronisation Remote - A connection to another repository, usually on a server.\nTracking Branch - A local branch that has a direct relationship to a remote branch.\nUpstream Branch - The remote branch that your local branch is tracking.\nChanges \u0026amp; Differences Modified - Files that have been changed but not yet staged.\nStaged - Files that have been added to the staging area and are ready to be committed.\nUntracked - Files in your working directory that Git isn\u0026rsquo;t monitoring.\nDiff - The difference between two versions of a file or sets of files.\nPatch - A file containing changes between versions that can be applied to another codebase.\nConflict Resolution Merge Conflict - Occurs when Git cannot automatically resolve differences between two sets of changes.\nConflict Markers - Special notation (\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;, =======, \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;) inserted by Git to show conflicting sections in files.\nResolution - The process of manually editing files to resolve conflicts between different versions.\nVersion References Hash/SHA - A unique identifier (e.g., a1b2c3d4...) for each commit in Git.\nTag - A named pointer to a specific commit, typically used for release versions.\nHEAD~n - A relative reference to the nth commit before HEAD.\nAdvanced Concepts Detached HEAD - A state where you\u0026rsquo;re viewing a specific commit rather than a branch.\nCherry-pick - Applying a specific commit from one branch to another.\nSubmodule - A repository embedded within another repository.\nGitignore - A file that tells Git which files or folders to ignore in a project.\nHook - Scripts that run automatically at certain points in Git\u0026rsquo;s execution.\nReflog - A log of where your HEAD and branches have been.\nFast-forward - A simplified merge that occurs when the target branch hasn\u0026rsquo;t changed since the feature branch was created.\nPractical Terminology Pull Request (PR) - On platforms like GitHub, a request to merge changes from one branch to another, usually with code review.\nCode Review - The process of examining code changes before they\u0026rsquo;re merged.\nBranch Protection - Rules that prevent certain actions on important branches without proper authorisation.\nContinuous Integration (CI) - Automated testing that runs whenever code is pushed to a repository.\nContinuous Deployment (CD) - Automated deployment of code that passes CI tests.\nConclusion Git can seem intimidating at first, but with practice, these commands and concepts will become second nature. The key is to use Git regularly, starting with simple operations and gradually incorporating more advanced features into your workflow.\nGit is designed to be a safety net for your code. Don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to experiment; you can always recover your work if something goes wrong.\n","permalink":"https://michaelbrunger.com/introduction-to-git/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"git-crash-course-for-beginners-commands-workflow--terminology\"\u003eGit Crash Course for Beginners: Commands, Workflow \u0026amp; Terminology\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re new to Git, you\u0026rsquo;re about to discover one of the most powerful tools in a developer\u0026rsquo;s toolkit.

As I learn Python myself, I\u0026rsquo;ll be documenting my journey here. This first post covers the essentials to get you up and running with Python on Windows:\nWhat Python is and why it\u0026rsquo;s worth learning Installing Python on Windows (with step-by-step instructions) Quick install notes for macOS \u0026amp; Linux users Writing your first \u0026ldquo;Hello, World!\u0026rdquo; program Using the Python interactive shell 1. What Is Python (and Why Learn It)? Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that\u0026rsquo;s gained enormous popularity for good reason. After looking into various languages, I chose to learn Python because:\nReadability: Its clean syntax uses indentation and fewer symbols than languages like C++ or Java, making code easier to understand Versatility: It\u0026rsquo;s used across multiple domains from web development (Django, Flask) to data analysis (NumPy, pandas) and automation Package ecosystem: PyPI (Python Package Index) hosts over 400,000 third-party packages that extend Python\u0026rsquo;s capabilities Community support: Extensive documentation, forums, and tutorials make finding help straightforward For me as a finance professional, Python\u0026rsquo;s data analysis capabilities are particularly valuable, but its applications stretch across many fields.\n2. Installing Python on Windows Here\u0026rsquo;s how to get Python installed on Windows 10/11:\n2.1 Download the Installer Visit the official Python download page: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows Click the button for the latest stable release (currently Python 3.11.x) 2.2 Run the Installer Locate and double-click the downloaded file (typically named python-3.x.x-amd64.exe) IMPORTANT: Check the box that says \u0026ldquo;Add Python 3.x to PATH\u0026rdquo; at the bottom of the installer This allows you to run Python from any directory in Command Prompt Click \u0026ldquo;Install Now\u0026rdquo; for the standard installation, or \u0026ldquo;Customise installation\u0026rdquo; if you want to change specific options 2.3 Verify the Installation Open Command Prompt (press Win + R, type cmd, and hit Enter) Type the following command and press Enter: python --version You should see output like: Python 3.11.4 (Your version number might differ) 3. Quick Notes for macOS \u0026amp; Linux macOS:\nMany Macs come with Python 2.7 preinstalled, but you\u0026rsquo;ll want Python 3 The simplest approach is using Homebrew: brew install python Alternatively, download the installer from python.org Linux:\nMost Linux distributions include Python For Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt update sudo apt install python3 python3-pip For complete instructions, see the official Python documentation:\nmacOS: https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html Linux: https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html 4. Your First \u0026ldquo;Hello, World!\u0026rdquo; Script Time to write your first Python program:\nIn Command Prompt, navigate to a folder where you want to create your script:\ncd C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\Documents Create a new file named hello.py using any text editor (Notepad, VS Code, etc.)\nType this line in the file:\nprint(\u0026#34;Hello, World!\u0026#34;) Save the file, then run it by typing in Command Prompt:\npython hello.py You should see:\nHello, World! Congratulations—you\u0026rsquo;ve written and executed your first Python program!\n5. Exploring the Python Interactive Shell Python comes with an interactive shell (also called a REPL—Read-Evaluate-Print Loop) that lets you test code snippets immediately:\nIn Command Prompt, simply type:\npython You\u0026rsquo;ll see the Python prompt (\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;) where you can type code directly:\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; 2 + 2 4 \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; name = \u0026#34;Python\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; print(f\u0026#34;I\u0026#39;m learning {name}!\u0026#34;) I\u0026#39;m learning Python!

Text Editors vs. IDEs for Python Development Lightweight editors (Notepad++, Sublime) vs. full IDEs (VS Code, PyCharm) Setting up VS Code for Python (extensions, linting, auto‑format) Code highlighting, IntelliSense/autocomplete, and snippets Running and debugging code from your editor Quick intro to IDE‑based breakpoints vs. print‑driven debugging 3. Python Syntax Fundamentals \u0026amp; Language Features Variables, data types (numbers, strings, booleans) and operators Indentation and control flow (if/elif/else, loops) Comprehensions \u0026amp; lambdas: list/dict/set comprehensions, map/filter, anonymous functions Iterators \u0026amp; generators: the iterator protocol, writing your own with yield Basic error handling: try/except, else/finally 4. Core Data Structures Lists: creation, indexing, slicing, methods Tuples: immutability, packing/unpacking Dictionaries: key–value access, common methods Sets: uniqueness, union/intersection/difference Choosing the right structure for the task 5. Functions, Modules \u0026amp; File I/O Defining and calling functions (def, return, positional vs. keyword args) Variable scope and namespaces Organising code into modules and packages Exploring the Standard Library (math, random, datetime, os, sys) Reading from/writing to text files with open() and the with statement 6. Virtual Environments \u0026amp; Packaging Why virtual environments matter (avoiding dependency conflicts) Creating/activating/deactivating venv on Windows (and notes for macOS/Linux) Managing packages with pip: install, freeze, requirements.txt Basic packaging: project structure, setup.py/pyproject.toml essentials Publishing to PyPI with twine and versioning best practices Professional Best Practices (Posts 7–9) 7. Code Quality \u0026amp; Collaboration Version control fundamentals with Git \u0026amp; GitHub (clone, commit, push, pull requests) Writing clean, PEP 8‑compliant code; linting with flake8 Auto‑formatting with black and organising imports with isort Writing docstrings (Google vs. NumPy style) and auto‑generating docs (Sphinx overview) 8. Testing \u0026amp; Debugging Unit testing basics with unittest and pytest (assertions, test discovery) Fixtures in pytest and intro to TDD workflows Raising and defining custom exceptions (raise, subclassing Exception) Using the debugger: pdb commands and IDE‑based breakpoints Structured logging with the logging module (levels, handlers, formatting) 9. Command‑Line Tools \u0026amp; Automation Building CLI scripts with argparse: positional args, flags, help text Packaging entry points (console_scripts) for installable commands Automating file/folder tasks (os, shutil): renaming, organising, backups Automating GUI interactions with PyAutoGUI (keyboard/mouse control) Putting it all together in a sample automation project Core Tools \u0026amp; Data (Posts 10–13) 10. The Python Ecosystem \u0026amp; Interactive Data Workflows Clarify package vs. environment managers: pip vs. conda vs. Anaconda When and why to choose each (lightweight vs. data‑science bundles) Installing and exploring Anaconda Navigator Jupyter Notebooks: installing via pip/Anaconda, notebook anatomy (code vs. Markdown), basic plots inline 11. NumPy Fundamentals for Numerical Data Installing NumPy The ndarray: creation, indexing, slicing Vectorized operations and broadcasting rules Performance comparison vs. pure Python lists 12. Data Analysis with pandas Installing pandas Understanding Series and DataFrame objects Reading data (CSV, Excel), inspecting and summarising Selection, filtering, grouping, transformation Handling missing data 13. Data Visualisation Basics Matplotlib core: line, scatter, bar, histogram plots Customising labels, titles, legends Seaborn intro: statistical plot types (boxplot, heatmap) Saving figures to files for reports Intermediate Applications (Posts 14–17) 14. Introduction to Object‑Oriented Programming (OOP) Classes vs. objects, attributes vs. methods The init constructor and self Encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism (simple examples) Why OOP matters: organising and reusing code 15. Web Development Foundations Option A: Flask (lightweight): setting up, routes, templates, serving static files Option B: Django (full‑featured): project/app structure, admin interface, ORM intro Option C: Web Scraping: requests + BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing Deploying your first minimal web app on a free hosting platform (e.g., Heroku) 16. Building Simple GUI Applications with Tkinter Installing/importing Tkinter (built‑in) Creating windows, labels, buttons, entry widgets Layout managers (pack, grid) A hands‑on mini‑project: e.g., basic calculator or temperature converter 17. Next Steps \u0026amp; Advanced Topics Concurrency \u0026amp; async: when to use threads vs. processes (threading, multiprocessing), intro to asyncio End‑to‑end mini‑project ideas (combine web, data, GUI, testing) Recommended books, courses, blogs, and community resources Tips for staying sharp: code challenges, open‑source contribution, local meetups ","permalink":"https://michaelbrunger.com/python-learning-path/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"my-python-learning-journey\"\u003eMy Python Learning Journey\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWelcome to my Python learning series!
