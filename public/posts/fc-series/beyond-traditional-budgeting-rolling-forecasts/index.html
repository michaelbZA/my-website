Budgeting This post is part of my “learning in public” journey as I transition into my role as a finance manager. All concepts and frameworks are attributed to their original creators, primarily David Parmenter and other thought leaders in the field.\nThe Problem with Traditional Annual Budgets Most organizations still cling to the annual budgeting process despite mounting evidence of its ineffectiveness. As David Parmenter points out in his book “The Financial Controller and CFO’s Toolkit,” traditional budgets often become outdated shortly after completion due to rapidly changing business conditions.\nAccording to Parmenter (2017), the traditional budgeting process suffers from several fundamental flaws:\nTime-consuming and expensive - Finance teams typically spend months preparing budgets that become obsolete within weeks Based on unsupported assumptions - Many budgets are built on guesswork rather than reliable forecasting techniques Encourages dysfunctional behaviors - Department managers often engage in “gaming the system,” padding budgets or spending unnecessarily to protect future allocations Disconnected from strategy - Annual budgets rarely align with the organization’s strategic objectives Too rigid for today’s dynamic business environment - Annual budgets lack the flexibility to adapt to rapidly changing market conditions As Parmenter notes, “Annual planning is a relic of the past and was designed for a stable, predictable business environment that no longer exists.”\nThe Beyond Budgeting Movement Jeremy Hope and Robin Fraser pioneered the “Beyond Budgeting” movement that provides a radical alternative to traditional budgeting processes. Their research, documented in “Beyond Budgeting: How Managers Can Break Free from the Annual Performance Trap” (2003), identified twelve principles for organizations seeking to move beyond conventional budgeting approaches.\nCore Beyond Budgeting Principles Performance Management Principles: Set relative goals rather than fixed targets Reward shared success based on relative performance, not meeting fixed targets Make planning a continuous and inclusive process Make resources available as needed, not through annual budget allocations Coordinate cross-company interactions dynamically, not through annual plans Base controls on KPIs, trends, and relative indicators, not budget variances Leadership Principles: Provide a governance framework based on clear values and boundaries Create a high-performance climate based on relative success Delegate decision-making authority to operational managers Make teams accountable for customer outcomes Create a transparent information system providing fast, open information Use performance metrics to promote improvement, not control Parmenter’s Rolling Forecast Solution While completely abandoning budgets may be too dramatic a step for many organizations, Parmenter advocates for quarterly rolling forecasts as a practical middle ground. This approach maintains some structure while addressing many of the shortcomings of traditional budgeting.\nKey Elements of Quarterly Rolling Forecasts According to Parmenter (2017), an effective rolling forecast system includes:\nLooking out 5-6 quarters - Always maintaining a 12-18 month forward view Focusing on key drivers - Forecasting 10-12 key business variables rather than detailed line items Using current business knowledge - Incorporating the latest market intelligence and operational data Separating targets from forecasts - Ensuring forecasts represent the most likely outcome, not a target Completing within 5-6 working days - Making the process quick and efficient Involving the whole management team - Not just a finance exercise As Parmenter states, “Rolling forecasts should be light-touch forecasts focusing on key drivers that can be prepared quickly.”\nImplementation Roadmap: From Traditional to Rolling Forecasts Transitioning from traditional annual budgeting to rolling forecasts requires careful change management. Here’s a practical roadmap based on Parmenter’s recommendations:\nPhase 1: Preparation (3-6 months) Form a cross-functional implementation team Educate senior leadership on the limitations of traditional budgeting Identify key business drivers for forecasting Design a simplified forecasting template Establish a proof of concept with one business unit Document the proposed new process Phase 2: Implementation (6-12 months) Run traditional budgeting process alongside rolling forecasts Progressively reduce the detail in the annual budget Train finance team and business managers on new processes Implement supporting technology Begin reporting based on forecast variances rather than budget variances Review and refine the process Phase 3: Optimization (12+ months) Phase out the traditional annual budget completely Integrate rolling forecasts with strategic planning Adjust performance evaluation and incentive systems Implement continuous improvement of the forecasting process Overcoming Resistance to Change Implementing rolling forecasts typically encounters resistance, particularly from those comfortable with the status quo. Parmenter suggests several strategies to address this resistance:\nFocus on benefits - Quantify the time savings and improved decision-making Start with a pilot - Demonstrate success in one department before rolling out company-wide Secure senior leadership support - Ensure the CFO and CEO champion the change Train extensively - Invest in developing new skills and capabilities Communicate constantly - Explain the “why” behind the changes Make it easier - Ensure new processes are simpler than the old ones Case Study: A Mid-Size Manufacturing Company A manufacturing company with $120 million in annual revenue implemented quarterly rolling forecasts based on Parmenter’s methodology. They identified 12 key business drivers, including:\nRaw material costs for key inputs Production volume by major product line Average selling price by product line Headcount in key departments Energy consumption Exchange rates for major currencies Their previous annual budgeting process took 12 weeks and produced a 50-page document. After implementing rolling forecasts, they could produce a comprehensive forecast in just 5 days that proved more accurate than their previous annual budget.\nThe finance team reported spending 70% less time on forecasting activities while providing more valuable information to decision-makers. In the first year alone, they identified $3.2 million in cost-saving opportunities that would have been missed under the traditional budgeting approach.\nIntegrating with Performance Management Hope and Fraser emphasize that beyond budgeting isn’t just a financial process change—it represents a fundamental shift in how organizations manage performance.\nTo fully realize the benefits, organizations should consider:\nSeparating target-setting from forecasting - Targets should stretch performance, while forecasts should be realistic Using relative performance measures - Comparing to competitors and past performance rather than fixed targets Implementing a balanced scorecard approach - As developed by Kaplan and Norton, to ensure financial and non-financial measures are considered Revising incentive systems - Moving from individual budget-based bonuses to team-based relative performance rewards Tools and Technology Enablers The right tools can significantly streamline the rolling forecast process. Options include:\nPurpose-built planning software - Solutions like Adaptive Insights, Anaplan, or Prophix Business intelligence tools - Power BI, Tableau, or QlikView for visualization Enhanced spreadsheet models - More sophisticated Excel models with proper controls Cloud-based collaboration platforms - Enabling distributed teams to collaborate effectively Self-Assessment: Is Your Organization Ready? Rate your organization on these dimensions from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree):\nOur current budgeting process adds significant value to decision-making Our budgets remain relevant throughout the year Our budgeting process takes less than 4 weeks from start to finish Business managers view budgeting as a valuable exercise rather than a burden Our budgets support rather than hinder agile decision-making Our organization could respond quickly to a major market disruption We regularly forecast beyond the current financial year Our forecasts focus on key business drivers rather than detailed line items Senior leaders would support significant changes to our budgeting process Scoring:\n36-45: You’re already embracing modern budgeting practices 27-35: Good foundation, but room for improvement 18-26: Significant modernization needed 9-17: Traditional budgeting is likely causing organizational pain Action Items for Finance Leaders Document your current budgeting process - Map out steps, timelines, and resource requirements Identify your key business drivers - What truly moves the needle for your organization? Build a simple rolling forecast model - Start with just the key drivers Experiment with a quarterly forecast - Run it alongside your current process Measure the time investment - Quantify how much effort goes into budgeting and forecasting Engage stakeholders - Discuss pain points and potential improvements with business partners Conclusion Moving beyond traditional budgeting represents one of the most significant opportunities for modern finance teams to add value to their organizations. By embracing more flexible, forward-looking approaches like rolling forecasts, finance leaders can provide more timely insights while freeing up valuable resources for more strategic activities.\nAs David Parmenter emphasizes, “The annual planning process has been a major barrier to effective performance management.” By adopting the principles outlined in this post, you can begin transforming your finance function from a backwards-looking reporting entity to a forward-looking strategic partner.\nWhat’s your experience with budgeting processes?
