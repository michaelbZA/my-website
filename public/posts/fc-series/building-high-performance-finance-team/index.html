Parmenter","leadership"],"articleBody":"Part 6: Building a High-Performance Finance Team This post continues my “learning in public” journey as a finance manager. All concepts and frameworks are attributed to their original creators, primarily David Parmenter and other thought leaders in the field.\nThe Finance Team Evolution As finance functions transition from traditional accounting and reporting roles to strategic business partnership, the capabilities and culture of the finance team must evolve accordingly. David Parmenter, in “The Financial Controller and CFO’s Toolkit,” emphasizes that “winning finance teams” are distinguished not just by technical competence but by their ability to influence business outcomes.\nAccording to Parmenter, “The difference between an average finance team and a world-class one isn’t just knowledge—it’s how that knowledge is applied to create value for the organization.”\nThis post explores how finance leaders can build high-performance teams capable of meeting the evolving demands of modern business.\nParmenter’s Team Development Framework David Parmenter proposes a comprehensive framework for developing high-performance finance teams, structured around four key dimensions:\n1. Team Structure and Roles The traditional hierarchical structure of finance departments often impedes performance. Parmenter advocates for a flatter team structure with clear accountability:\nFinance business partners embedded within operational units Centers of excellence for specialized knowledge (tax, treasury, etc.) Shared service centers for transactional processes Small, agile teams focused on specific business outcomes According to Parmenter, “Structure should follow strategy—organize your team around the outcomes you want to achieve, not historical departmental boundaries.”\n2. Skills and Capabilities Modern finance teams require a broader skill set than traditional accounting-focused departments. Parmenter identifies several critical competencies:\nBusiness acumen - Understanding the organization’s business model and value drivers Data analytics - Ability to extract insights from complex data sets Communication - Translating financial concepts for non-financial audiences Change management - Implementing new processes and systems effectively Critical thinking - Moving beyond reporting to insight and recommendation Relationship building - Creating partnerships with operational teams Parmenter notes, “Technical accounting skills are the price of entry—they get you a seat at the table. But influence skills are what allow you to make an impact once you’re there.”\n3. Systems and Processes High-performance teams leverage effective systems and processes to maximize productivity:\nStandardized workflows for routine activities Knowledge management systems to capture and share institutional knowledge Performance management frameworks aligned with organizational goals Continuous improvement mechanisms to identify and address inefficiencies Technology enablement to automate transactional work As Parmenter states, “The goal is to automate the routine so your team can focus on the exceptional.”\n4. Culture and Mindset Perhaps most importantly, high-performance finance teams cultivate a distinctive culture:\nForward-looking rather than historical focus Solution-oriented approach to problems Continuous learning and skill development Collaborative rather than siloed mentality Customer-centric orientation (both internal and external customers) Balanced scorecard perspective beyond just financial metrics Parmenter emphasizes, “Culture isn’t just how people behave when everything is going well—it’s how they respond when things get difficult.”\nIdentifying and Developing Talent Within Your Team Building a high-performance team starts with understanding your current talent and systematically developing their capabilities.\nTalent Assessment Parmenter recommends a structured approach to evaluating team members:\nSkills inventory - Document current technical and soft skills Performance evaluation - Assess effectiveness in current roles Potential assessment - Identify capacity for growth and advancement Career aspirations - Understand individual goals and motivations Learning styles - Determine how each person best acquires new skills This assessment provides the foundation for targeted development efforts.\nDevelopment Strategies Based on talent assessments, Parmenter suggests several development approaches:\n1. Structured Rotation Programs Cross-functional rotations within finance (accounting to FP\u0026A, etc.) Business rotations into operational roles Project-based assignments to build specific skills “Shadow” programs with senior leaders As Parmenter notes, “Experience is the best teacher—expose your team to diverse challenges to accelerate their development.”\n2. Mentoring and Coaching Formal mentoring programs pairing junior and senior staff External coaching for high-potential individuals Peer coaching networks to share knowledge Regular feedback sessions beyond annual reviews 3. Targeted Training Technical skills training for new tools and methodologies Soft skills development (presentation, influence, etc.) Industry-specific knowledge building Professional certification support 4. Stretch Assignments Leading cross-functional projects Presenting to executive leadership Representing finance in operational meetings Conducting training for non-finance colleagues Parmenter emphasizes, “Development happens at the edge of comfort—provide challenges that stretch but don’t break your team members.”\nCreating a Culture of Continuous Improvement High-performance finance teams are never satisfied with the status quo. They continuously seek ways to improve processes, systems, and outcomes.\nKaizen in Finance Borrowing from lean manufacturing principles, Parmenter advocates applying kaizen (continuous improvement) methodologies to finance:\nMake problems visible - Create visual management systems that highlight issues Standardize processes - Document standard procedures as the foundation for improvement Measure what matters - Establish KPIs for finance team performance (cycle times, accuracy, etc.) Create improvement mechanisms - Regular sessions to identify and address inefficiencies Celebrate small wins - Recognize incremental improvements to build momentum Process Improvement Techniques Specific tools that finance teams can apply include:\nValue stream mapping - Visualizing end-to-end processes to identify waste 5 Whys analysis - Drilling to root causes of problems PDCA cycles (Plan-Do-Check-Act) - Structured approach to testing improvements Gemba walks - Observing processes firsthand to identify improvement opportunities Standard work - Documenting best practices to ensure consistency As Parmenter states, “Continuous improvement isn’t a project with an end date—it’s a permanent mindset shift.”\nJack Stack’s Open-Book Management Jack Stack, author of “The Great Game of Business,” developed the concept of open-book management, which has powerful applications for finance teams. The approach is based on three core principles:\n1. Financial Transparency Sharing financial information broadly within the organization Teaching employees to understand financial statements Connecting individual actions to financial outcomes Demystifying financial terminology and concepts 2. Employee Empowerment Involving team members in planning and forecasting Delegating decision authority with appropriate guardrails Creating ownership mentality through participation Soliciting improvement ideas from all levels 3. Shared Rewards Aligning incentives with organizational success Creating bonus systems tied to measurable outcomes Celebrating wins collectively Fostering mutual accountability for results According to Stack, “When people understand the business and have a stake in the outcome, they make better decisions and take greater ownership.”\nImplementing Open-Book Management in Finance For finance teams specifically, open-book management can be implemented through:\nWeekly financial huddles - Brief meetings to review key metrics Visual scorecards - Prominently displayed performance indicators Financial literacy training - Ensuring all team members understand the numbers Collaborative forecasting - Involving the entire team in projections Shared performance goals - Team-based metrics and incentives As Parmenter notes, “Open-book management transforms finance from a mysterious black box to a transparent enabler of performance.”\nTraining Strategies for Upskilling Your Finance Team Developing a high-performance finance team requires systematic upskilling. Parmenter recommends a blended approach to training:\n1. Technical Skills Development ERP and systems training - Ensuring proficiency with core tools Advanced Excel and data visualization - Building analytical capabilities Accounting and regulatory updates - Maintaining technical foundation Financial modeling - Enhancing forecasting and scenario planning skills Process improvement methodologies - Teaching lean and six sigma techniques 2. Business Acumen Building Industry immersion - Understanding the organization’s competitive landscape Business model training - Learning how the organization creates value Strategy sessions - Participating in strategic planning discussions Customer exposure - Interacting directly with external customers Operational shadowing - Spending time in key operational areas 3. Leadership Development Communication workshops - Enhancing presentation and influence skills Change management training - Building capability to implement new initiatives Conflict resolution - Developing skills to navigate difficult conversations Project management - Leading cross-functional initiatives Coaching skills - Learning to develop others effectively 4. Learning Formats Parmenter emphasizes the importance of varied learning formats:\nFormal classroom training - For foundational knowledge On-the-job application - Immediate use of new skills Digital learning platforms - Self-paced skill development Community of practice - Peer learning groups External conferences - Exposure to industry best practices Stretch assignments - Learning through doing As Parmenter notes, “The most effective learning combines instruction, application, and reflection in a continuous cycle.”\nCase Study: Finance Transformation at a Global Manufacturer This case study, based on a composite of organizations in Parmenter’s research, illustrates the principles of high-performance team building in action:\nBackground A global manufacturing company with $3 billion in annual revenue had a finance team that was respected for accuracy but criticized for being reactive and transaction-focused. The newly appointed CFO aimed to transform the team into a strategic business partner.\nKey Challenges 80% of finance time spent on transaction processing and reporting Limited business acumen among technically skilled accountants Siloed structure with poor cross-functional collaboration Resistance to change among long-tenured staff Outdated skills with minimal investment in development Transformation Approach Phase 1: Assessment and Vision (3 months) Conducted skills assessment of all finance staff Benchmarked team structure and processes against leading practices Created a compelling vision of the future finance function Established clear performance metrics for the transformation Phase 2: Structural Changes (6 months) Reorganized from functional silos to business-aligned teams Created centers of excellence for specialized knowledge Established a shared service center for transactional activities Implemented business partner roles embedded in operational units Phase 3: Capability Building (12 months) Launched comprehensive training program in business acumen Implemented rotational assignments across finance and operations Created mentoring pairs between senior and junior staff Established a finance academy with targeted learning paths Phase 4: Cultural Transformation (18+ months) Introduced open-book management principles Implemented continuous improvement methodologies Changed performance evaluation criteria to emphasize business impact Celebrated and rewarded new behaviors aligned with vision Results After two years, the transformation delivered significant results:\nTransaction processing time reduced by 60% Finance headcount reallocated: from 20% to 60% in business partner roles Employee engagement scores increased from 65% to 88% Internal customer satisfaction increased from 3.2 to 4.7 (on 5-point scale) Finance-led initiatives delivered $45 million in cost savings and revenue enhancements As the CFO commented, “We transformed from being financial record-keepers to true business partners driving organizational performance.”\nSelf-Assessment: How High-Performing Is Your Finance Team? Rate your team on these dimensions from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree):\nOur finance team is structured around business outcomes rather than functional silos Team members have strong business acumen beyond technical accounting skills We have effective systems for sharing knowledge across the team Our team consistently anticipates business needs rather than reacting to requests We have formal processes for continuous improvement Team members regularly rotate through different roles and assignments Our finance team is viewed as a valued business partner by operational leaders We have a structured approach to developing team capabilities Our performance metrics focus on business impact, not just technical accuracy Our team culture encourages innovation and appropriate risk-taking Scoring:\n40-50: High-performance team 30-39: Strong foundation with opportunity for enhancement 20-29: Traditional team with significant development needs 10-19: Fundamental transformation required Action Items for Finance Leaders Assess your current state - Conduct a comprehensive skills inventory of your team Clarify your vision - Define what “high performance” means in your specific context Identify development needs - Map the gap between current and desired capabilities Create learning paths - Develop tailored development plans for team members Review team structure - Align organizational design with strategic priorities Implement mentoring - Create formal and informal knowledge-sharing mechanisms Measure and recognize - Establish metrics for team performance and celebrate progress Conclusion Building a high-performance finance team is not a one-time project but an ongoing journey of development and improvement. By applying Parmenter’s team development framework and Stack’s open-book management principles, finance leaders can create teams that deliver exceptional value to their organizations.\nAs David Parmenter emphasizes, “The finance function of the future will be judged not by the accuracy of its reporting but by the impact of its insights.” By investing in your team’s capabilities, structure, processes, and culture, you can position your finance function as a true strategic partner in organizational success.\nWhat approaches have you found most effective in developing finance team capabilities?
