## Introduction

Start with a brief introduction to your topic. Explain what the reader will learn and why it matters. Consider adding a hook to engage readers from the start.

This paragraph provides more context and background information needed to understand the rest of the post.

## Main Section

Here's where you dive into your main content. Break down your topic into logical sections with clear headings.

### Sub-section 1

Text explaining the first sub-topic or step in your process. Include relevant explanations and examples.

Here's a simple Python code example:

```python
def hello_world():
    """A simple function that prints a greeting"""
    print("Hello, world!")
    
    # You can include comments in your code blocks
    for i in range(3):
        print(f"Count: {i}")
        
hello_world()
```

#### Output:
```
Hello, world!
Count: 0
Count: 1
Count: 2
```

### Sub-section 2

Continue with more explanations and examples as needed.

You can include inline code like `variable_name` or `function_name()` within your paragraphs.

## Working with Data

If your post involves data analysis or manipulation, you might include code that demonstrates this:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample data creation
data = {
    'Category': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'],
    'Values': [10, 23, 15, 8]
}

# Create a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Display the data
print(df)

# Create a simple visualization
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
plt.bar(df['Category'], df['Values'])
plt.title('Sample Data Visualization')
plt.xlabel('Category')
plt.ylabel('Values')
plt.show()
```

### Other Languages

You can also include code in other languages:

```javascript
// JavaScript example
function toggleDarkMode() {
    const body = document.querySelector('body');
    body.classList.toggle('dark-mode');
    
    // Save preference to localStorage
    const isDarkMode = body.classList.contains('dark-mode');
    localStorage.setItem('darkMode', isDarkMode);
}
```

```css
/* CSS example */
.container {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    max-width: 1200px;
    margin: 0 auto;
}
```

## Adding Images

You can add images to illustrate your points:

![Alt text description](/path/to/image.jpg "Optional title")

{{< figure src="/path/to/image.jpg" title="Figure 1: Description of the figure" alt="Alt text description" >}}

## Tables

Tables can be useful for displaying structured information:

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Data 1   | Data 2   | Data 3   |
| More data| More data| More data|

## Blockquotes

> Use blockquotes to highlight important information or to quote someone.
> 
> You can have multiple paragraphs in a blockquote by adding a blank line with the > symbol.

## Tips and Warnings

{{< notice note >}}
This is a note box that can be used for important information that isn't a warning.
{{< /notice >}}

{{< notice warning >}}
This is a warning box for critical information the reader should be aware of.
{{< /notice >}}

## Interactive Elements

If your theme supports shortcodes for interactive elements:

{{< details "Click to expand" >}}
This content is hidden by default and will be revealed when the user clicks.
{{< /details >}}

## Math Equations

If your Hugo setup supports LaTeX or KaTeX:

Inline equation: $E = mc^2$

Block equation:

$$
f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \hat{f}(\xi) e^{2 \pi i \xi x} d\xi
$$
