Hello there. I'm a South African chartered accountant who, about six years ago, decided that grey English skies were preferable to African sunshine. My wife somehow agreed with this decision, and we've since added two small humans to our family.

By day, I'm a finance manager, wrestling spreadsheets and making sure numbers behave themselves. By night (and weekends, and lunch breaks), I'm on a perpetual journey of learning new thingsâ€”some useful, others decidedly less so.

## What's This Site About?

This little corner of the internet serves as my "learning in public" experiment. I've decided that learning is more interesting when shared, even if that means documenting my inevitable mistakes for posterity.

Currently, I'm teaching myself Python, despite having relied on spreadsheets for most of my professional life. You can follow my progress here as I document the journey from basic concepts to (hopefully) more advanced applications, with all the inevitable stumbling blocks along the way.

Beyond coding, you'll find my musings on whatever has captured my attention that week:

- Philosophy
- Finance
- Parenting
- Science and health
- Other random fascinations

## The Fine Print

I'm not an expert in most of these areas. Yes, that's rather the point. This site isn't about presenting perfectly formed ideas, but rather about documenting the messy, non-linear process of learning something new.

Feel free to browse, comment, or get in touch.
