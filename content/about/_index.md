Hello there. I'm a South African chartered accountant who, about six years ago, decided that grey English skies were preferable to African sunshine. My wife agreed with this questionable decision, and we've since added two small humans to our family.

By day, I'm a finance manager, ensuring spreadsheets are orderly and numbers reconcile properly. Outside office hours, I dedicate time to learning new skills; some practical, others less immediately applicable.

## What's This Site About?

This site documents my "learning in public" journey. I believe knowledge is more valuable when shared, even if that means occasionally revealing my mistakes along the way.

Currently, I'm learning Python after years of relying primarily on Excel. You can follow my progress from basic concepts to more advanced applications, complete with the occasional troubleshooting detour.

Beyond coding, I share thoughts on various interests:
* Finance
* Parenting
* Science and health
* Other topics that capture my attention

## The Fine Print

I don't claim expertise in most of these areasâ€”that's rather the point. This site isn't about presenting polished conclusions, but rather documenting the sometimes messy process of acquiring new knowledge.

Feel free to browse, comment, or reach out.
