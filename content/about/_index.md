Hello there. I'm a South African chartered accountant who, about six years ago, decided that grey English skies were preferable to African sunshine. My wife somehow agreed with this questionable decision, and we've since added two small humans to our expedition.

By day, I'm a finance manager, wrestling spreadsheets and making sure numbers behave themselves. By night (and weekends, and lunch breaks), I'm on a perpetual journey of learning new things—some useful, others decidedly less so.

## What's This Site About?

This little corner of the internet serves as my "learning in public" experiment. I've decided that learning is more interesting when shared, even if that means documenting my inevitable mistakes for posterity.

Currently, I'm teaching myself Python, despite having relied on spreadsheets for most of my professional life. You can follow my progress here as I document the journey from basic concepts to (hopefully) more advanced applications, with all the inevitable stumbling blocks along the way.

Beyond coding, you'll find my musings on whatever has captured my attention that week:

- Philosophy (mostly pondering why we're here while drinking tea)
- Psychology (trying to understand why I procrastinate by reading about procrastination)
- Parenting (field notes from the frontlines of raising two boys)
- Science and health (interpreting research papers so you don't have to)
- Other random fascinations that strike without warning

## The Fine Print

No, I'm not an expert in most of these areas. Yes, that's rather the point. This site isn't about presenting perfectly formed ideas, but rather about documenting the messy, non-linear process of learning something new.

Feel free to browse, comment, or get in touch. Just don't expect boundless enthusiasm—I'm South African with a British postal code now, after all. We do reserved optimism at best.
