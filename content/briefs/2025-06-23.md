## Executive Summary

In the past 24 hours, global tensions escalated as the US conducted strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, drawing international condemnation and highlighting risks of broader Middle East conflict. Meanwhile, technological advancements took center stage with Tesla's launch of robotaxi services in Austin, Texas, amid ongoing AI developments like OpenAI's hardware deals, which face legal hurdles. Domestically in the UK, Prime Minister Keir Starmer emphasized diplomacy in response to the US actions, while environmental concerns mounted over potential water contamination from a French mine site. These events underscore rising geopolitical instability and rapid AI innovation, with potential economic ripple effects from tech breakthroughs and international escalations.

## Key Trends & Sentiment

- **Significant Sentiment Shifts**: 1. Growing public frustration with Western leaders' perceived inaction on the US-Israel-Iran conflict, as evidenced by protests and op-eds criticizing detached rhetoric. 2.
