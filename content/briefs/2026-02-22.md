## Executive Summary

In the past 24 hours, global tensions escalated with Donald Trump announcing a tariff hike from 10% to 15% following a Supreme Court ruling, potentially disrupting international trade and affecting economies worldwide. Meanwhile, the Russia-Ukraine conflict entered its 1,459th day with ongoing military actions, including Pakistan's strikes in Afghanistan that killed dozens, raising fears of regional instability. Domestically in the UK, former Prime Minister Boris Johnson called for non-combat troops to Ukraine, while AI developments sparked concerns, including a suspect's use of ChatGPT in planning violence and overdependence on AI tools, highlighting ethical and security risks. These events underscore growing geopolitical volatility and technological challenges amid elections and conflicts.
