Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions escalated as Iran condemned U.S. plans to resume nuclear testing under the Trump administration, highlighting ongoing friction over nuclear policies. Domestically, the UK faced scrutiny with King Charles III stripping Prince Andrew of his titles and evicting him from his residence due to renewed allegations tied to Jeffrey Epstein, underscoring pressures on the royal family. On the environmental front, new research from The Economist revealed rising deaths from climate-related events like heatwaves and wildfires, emphasizing the urgent need for global action. These stories reflect a mix of educational innovation, international diplomacy, and institutional accountability as key drivers of today's headlines.
