## Executive Summary

In the past 24 hours, key developments spanned technology, politics, and global affairs. Nvidia reclaimed its position as the world's most valuable company, driven by surging AI demand, highlighting the sector's explosive growth. Meanwhile, the UK government made concessions to Labour rebels over controversial welfare reforms, averting a potential crisis amid internal party backlash. Internationally, India successfully evacuated over 4,400 nationals from conflict zones in Iran and Israel, underscoring escalating Middle East tensions. On the environmental front, Redwood Materials launched a new business repurposing old EV batteries for energy storage, addressing sustainability challenges in AI data centers. These events signal rapid AI advancements and geopolitical volatility, with potential economic and policy ripple effects.

2. **UK Political News**
