## Executive Summary

In the past 24 hours, key developments spanned global crises, political scandals, and technological advancements. Over 900 people were killed in severe floods across Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Malaysia, highlighting the escalating impact of climate events. Politically, a British inquiry revealed allegations of deliberate killings by UK special forces in Afghanistan, while Labour MP Tulip Siddiq was sentenced to two years in prison in absentia for corruption in Bangladesh, raising questions about international accountability. In tech, James Cameron criticized generative AI as "horrifying," amid ongoing Cyber Monday deals that underscore consumer tech demand. These events signal growing tensions in global affairs and ethics in AI, with potential ripple effects on policy and markets.

## Key Trends & Sentiment

- **Significant Sentiment Shifts**: 1. Negative sentiment toward generative AI, shifting from excitement to concern over misuse, as evidenced by Cameron's comments and deepfake incidents targeting politicians. 2.
