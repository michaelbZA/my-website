## Executive Summary

In the past 24 hours, global tensions escalated as Thailand launched airstrikes along its border with Cambodia, reigniting a longstanding territorial dispute despite a fragile ceasefire. This development raises concerns about regional stability in Southeast Asia. Domestically, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for high-level talks on Ukraine's defense amid ongoing Russian threats, signaling Europe's unified response to potential U.S. policy shifts. In the tech sector, Netflix's $82.7 billion acquisition of Warner Bros. advanced after discussions with President Trump, highlighting the influence of political ties on major deals. Meanwhile, environmental issues gained attention with reports of human-animal conflicts in India and threats to the Amazon Rainforest from a proposed Chinese-backed port, underscoring the need for sustainable global policies.

## Key Trends & Sentiment

Heightened optimism for AI adoption in business, with partnerships like Accenture and OpenAI accelerating innovation.
