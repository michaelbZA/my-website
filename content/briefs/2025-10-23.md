First, the structure I need to follow:

1. **Executive Summary**: 1-2 paragraphs summarizing the most critical developments. Keep it concise.

2. **Key Trends & Sentiment**:
   - List 2 key emerging trends
   - Note 1-2 significant sentiment shifts
   - Highlight 1 key future implication

3. **Key Developments**: For each of the 5 categories, provide a single paragraph summary (50-75 words each). Each should:
   - Focus on the single most significant development
   - Rate its significance (High/Medium/Low)
   - Keep to 50-75 words

   Categories:
   - Tech & AI Developments
   - UK Political News
   - Global Affairs
   - Economic & Financial Updates
   - Climate & Environment

4. **Key Takeaways**:
   - List 3 most important implications
   - Note 1-2 developments to watch

The total brief should be 500-600 words.

Now, I need to analyze the articles and extract the most relevant information.
