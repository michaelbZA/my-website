## Executive Summary

In the past 24 hours, escalating tensions in the Middle East dominated headlines, with Iran launching airstrikes on Israel, resulting in at least five deaths and widespread damage, marking a significant escalation in their ongoing conflict. This development has drawn international concern, including from the U.S., where President Trump advised against targeting Iran's supreme leader. Concurrently, domestic incidents included severe weather in India, causing multiple fatalities from heavy rains, and U.S. political violence, with authorities capturing a suspect in the shooting of a House Speaker. These events underscore growing global instability, potential economic ripple effects from oil market fluctuations, and ongoing challenges in conflict resolution and environmental resilience.

Additionally, tech advancements featured prominently, with the U.S. Navy aggressively courting startups for innovation, amid concerns over AI's role in fueling conspiratorial thinking. The G7 summit in Canada was overshadowed by these crises, highlighting diplomatic strains, while lighter news included a golf tournament win and new consumer gadgets, offering brief distractions from broader geopolitical woes.

## Key Trends & Sentiment
