In the past 24 hours, global tensions escalated as Israeli forces intensified airstrikes on Gaza City, prompting evacuation warnings amid ongoing ceasefire negotiations, resulting in significant civilian casualties. Concurrently, OpenAI faced regulatory scrutiny over its potential restructuring and relocation from California, denying any plans to leave despite pressures, highlighting challenges in the AI sector. In the UK, the Labour Party opened nominations for a new deputy leader following Angela Rayner's departure, signaling internal shifts. Other notable developments include Nepal lifting a social media ban after deadly protests and advancements in AI technology, such as AMD's FSR 4 upscaling. These events underscore growing geopolitical instability and rapid tech evolution, with potential ripple effects on international relations and market dynamics.
