## Executive Summary

In the past 24 hours, global security concerns escalated with a mass stabbing on a UK train leaving nine people with life-threatening injuries, prompting a counter-terrorism investigation, and an Israeli air strike in Lebanon killing four, straining a fragile ceasefire. Additionally, US military actions intensified, including a strike in the Caribbean killing alleged drug smugglers and President Trump threatening intervention in Nigeria over Christian persecution claims. On a brighter note, technological advancements featured prominently, with AI breakthroughs like an enzyme for breaking down polyurethane and strong battery life in new smartphones, alongside economic jitters from Meta's stock dive due to AI spending. These developments highlight ongoing tensions in international relations and the dual-edged impact of tech innovation on society and the environment.
