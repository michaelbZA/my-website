In tech, Anthropic revealed a Chinese state-sponsored AI-orchestrated cyber espionage campaign, highlighting growing AI security risks, while economic updates feature a delayed U.S. jobs report and ongoing market volatility tied to tariff disputes. Globally, U.S. military strikes in the Caribbean have resulted in fatalities, raising concerns about regional instability, and environmental news spotlights severe flooding in Wales, underscoring climate vulnerabilities.
