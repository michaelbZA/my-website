## Executive Summary

In recent developments, global tensions escalated with ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, where Russian strikes hit Ukrainian cities and Israeli air raids targeted central Gaza amid stalled ceasefire talks. Domestically, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi pushed for a debate on Vande Mataram in Parliament, accusing opposition parties of historical distortions, highlighting cultural and political divides. In the tech sector, Netflix's proposed $82.7 billion acquisition of Warner Bros. sent shockwaves through Hollywood, potentially reshaping streaming and theatrical markets. Meanwhile, environmental concerns mounted over a massive Chinese-backed port in the Amazon, risking irreversible rainforest damage. These events underscore a mix of geopolitical instability, technological disruption, and ecological threats, with immediate implications for international relations and economic stability.
