## Executive Summary

In the past 24 hours, escalating tensions in the Middle East dominated headlines, with reports of Iranian-Israeli conflicts prompting evacuations and raising fears of a broader refugee crisis. Key developments included Israeli airstrikes and U.S. considerations of military options, alongside domestic arrests in India and Pakistan for alleged pro-Pakistan activities. In tech, SpaceX faced another setback with a Starship explosion during testing, highlighting ongoing challenges in space innovation. Environmentally, scientists warned that the world has just three years to limit global warming to 1.5°C, underscoring the urgent need for policy action. Meanwhile, economic updates showed stability in UK interest rates, but global markets reacted to oil price fluctuations amid geopolitical risks.

Sentiment across articles leaned toward heightened global anxiety, with calls for caution in interventions and optimism in AI advancements despite hurdles. These events signal potential disruptions in international relations and technology sectors, emphasizing the need for proactive monitoring.
