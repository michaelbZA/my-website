# Daily Intelligence Briefs

## How This Brief Is Made

Each morning, an automated script scans a curated selection of over 15 trusted RSS news feeds from across the political and geographic spectrum — including sources like BBC, The Guardian, Fox News, Al Jazeera, The Economist, and more. These feeds are filtered for relevance using a custom set of keywords spanning tech, politics, the economy, global affairs, climate, and security.

Articles published within the last 48 hours are extracted, de-duplicated, and sorted by recency. A maximum of 35 of the most relevant stories are selected.

If an AI key is available, these stories are passed to a language model (currently Grok-3 Mini) along with a structured prompt that generates a concise and readable intelligence-style brief. If no AI is available, a fallback system categorises and lists articles in markdown format under key topics.

The end result is a balanced, daily digest — summarising essential developments across technology, politics, finance, and more — ready to be published as a markdown file to the site using GitHub Actions.
