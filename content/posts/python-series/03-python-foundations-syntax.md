# Post 3: Python Syntax Fundamentals & Language Features

Welcome to the third post in my Python learning journey. In the first two posts, we installed Python and set up a proper development environment. Now it's time to dive into the language itself. This post covers the fundamental building blocks of Python code that I've been learning.

We'll explore:

1. Variables and basic data types
2. Operators and expressions
3. Control flow with conditionals and loops
4. List comprehensions and lambdas
5. Iterators and generators
6. Error handling with try/except

This post is a bit longer than the previous ones, but these fundamentals form the foundation of everything else in Python, so it's worth taking the time to understand them.

## 1. Variables and Basic Data Types

Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare variable types explicitly. Coming from Excel formulas where everything just works, I found this quite intuitive.

### 1.1 Variables and Assignment

Variables in Python are created when you first assign a value to them:

```python
# Creating variables
name = "Alex"
age = 35
hourly_rate = 45.50
is_python_fun = True
```

Variable names:
- Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores
- Cannot start with a number
- Are case-sensitive (`rate` and `Rate` are different variables)
- Should follow the `snake_case` convention (lowercase with underscores)

### 1.2 Basic Data Types

Python has several built-in data types:

#### Numbers
```python
# Integers (whole numbers)
count = 10
negative_number = -5

# Floating-point (decimals)
pi = 3.14159
discount_rate = 0.15

# Complex numbers
complex_number = 3 + 4j  # Not often used in business applications
```

#### Strings
```python
# Text enclosed in quotes (single or double)
first_name = "John"
last_name = 'Doe'

# Multi-line strings use triple quotes
address = """123 Main Street
Anytown, CA 12345"""

# String concatenation
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name  # "John Doe"

# f-strings (Python 3.6+) - my preferred way to format strings
greeting = f"Hello, {first_name}! You are {age} years old."
```

#### Booleans
```python
# True or False values
is_active = True
has_paid = False

# Boolean operations
is_valid_customer = is_active and has_paid  # False
can_contact = is_active or has_paid  # True
is_not_active = not is_active  # False
```

#### None Type
```python
# Represents absence of value (similar to NULL in databases)
result = None
```

### 1.3 Type Conversion

Python can convert between types:

```python
# String to number
age_str = "35"
age_num = int(age_str)  # 35 as integer
price_float = float("45.50")  # 45.5 as float

# Number to string
count_str = str(10)  # "10" as string

# Check type of a variable
print(type(age_num))  # <class 'int'>
```

## 2. Operators and Expressions

Python supports various operators for calculations and comparisons.

### 2.1 Arithmetic Operators

```python
a = 10
b = 3

addition = a + b        # 13
subtraction = a - b     # 7
multiplication = a * b  # 30
division = a / b        # 3.3333... (always returns float)
floor_division = a // b # 3 (integer division, rounds down)
modulus = a % b         # 1 (remainder of division)
exponent = a ** b       # 1000 (10 raised to power of 3)
```

### 2.2 Comparison Operators

```python
a = 10
b = 3

equal = a == b              # False
not_equal = a != b          # True
greater_than = a > b        # True
less_than = a < b           # False
greater_or_equal = a >= b   # True
less_or_equal = a <= b      # False
```

### 2.3 Assignment Operators

```python
# Simple assignment
x = 10

# Combined operators
x += 5   # Same as x = x + 5 (x becomes 15)
x -= 3   # Same as x = x - 3 (x becomes 12)
x *= 2   # Same as x = x * 2 (x becomes 24)
x /= 4   # Same as x = x / 4 (x becomes 6.0)
```

## 3. Control Flow

Control flow determines the order in which code executes based on conditions and loops.

### 3.1 Conditional Statements (if/elif/else)

Python uses indentation (whitespace) to define code blocks:

```python
age = 25

if age < 18:
    print("Minor")
elif age < 65:
    print("Adult")
else:
    print("Senior")
```

Multiple conditions:
