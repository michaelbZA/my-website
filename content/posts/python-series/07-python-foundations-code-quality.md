# Code Quality & Collaboration: Building Finance Tools That Last

As a finance professional learning Python, you'll soon want to move beyond writing scripts just for yourself. Whether you're building financial models, automating reporting, or creating data analysis tools, there comes a point when your code needs to be shared with colleagues or even the wider finance community. This post will guide you through best practices for creating high-quality, shareable code.

## Version Control: Git & GitHub for Financial Projects

### Why Version Control Matters in Finance

Imagine you've built a Python script that calculates key financial ratios from quarterly reports. After sharing it with your team, you make changes that accidentally break the debt-to-equity calculation. Without version control, finding and fixing this error could be a nightmare. With Git, you can simply revert to the previous working version.

In finance, where accuracy is paramount and regulatory compliance often requires audit trails, version control is essential.

### Getting Started with Git

First, [download and install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for your operating system.

Once installed, open a command prompt or terminal and set up your identity:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

### Creating Your First Finance Repository

Let's walk through creating a repository for a simple financial calculator:

1. Create a new directory for your project:

```bash
mkdir financial-ratio-calculator
cd financial-ratio-calculator
```

2. Initialis a Git repository:

```bash
git init
```

You'll see a message that an empty Git repository has been initialised.

3. Create a simple Python file called `ratio_calculator.py`:

```python
def calculate_current_ratio(current_assets, current_liabilities):
    """
    Calculate the current ratio.
    
    Args:
        current_assets (float): Total current assets
        current_liabilities (float): Total current liabilities
        
    Returns:
        float: Current ratio (current assets / current liabilities)
    """
    if current_liabilities == 0:
        raise ValueError("Current liabilities cannot be zero (division by zero)")
    return current_assets / current_liabilities

def calculate_debt_to_equity(total_debt, shareholders_equity):
    """
    Calculate the debt-to-equity ratio.
    
    Args:
        total_debt (float): Total debt
        shareholders_equity (float): Total shareholders' equity
        
    Returns:
        float: Debt-to-equity ratio (total debt / shareholders' equity)
    """
    if shareholders_equity == 0:
        raise ValueError("Shareholders' equity cannot be zero (division by zero)")
    return total_debt / shareholders_equity

# Add more financial ratios as needed
```

4. Track the file with Git:

```bash
git add ratio_calculator.py
```

5. Commit the changes:

```bash
git commit -m "Add basic financial ratio calculator functions"
```

### Core Git Commands for Daily Use

- `git status`: Check which files have been modified
- `git diff`: See exactly what changed in your files
- `git add <filename>`: Stage a file for commit
- `git commit -m "Your message"`: Commit staged changes
- `git log`: View commit history

### Branching for New Features

Branching lets you work on new features without affecting your main code. This is perfect for when you're adding new financial calculations to your toolkit.

```bash
# Create a branch for a new profitability ratio feature
git branch profitability-ratios

# Switch to that branch
git checkout profitability-ratios
```

Or do both at once:

```bash
git checkout -b profitability-ratios
```

Now add some code to your ratio_calculator.py file:

```python
def calculate_roe(net_income, average_shareholders_equity):
    """
    Calculate Return on Equity (ROE).
    
    Args:
        net_income (float): Net income for the period
        average_shareholders_equity (float): Average shareholders' equity
        
    Returns:
        float: ROE ratio (net income / average shareholders' equity)
    """
    if average_shareholders_equity == 0:
        raise ValueError("Average shareholders' equity cannot be zero")
    return net_income / average_shareholders_equity
```

Commit this new function:

```bash
git add ratio_calculator.py
git commit -m "Add ROE calculation function"
```

When you're ready to merge this back into your main code:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge profitability-ratios
```

### Collaborating with GitHub

GitHub extends Git's functionality by hosting your repositories online, making collaboration easier.

1. [Create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join) if you don't have one
2. Create a new repository on GitHub
3. Connect your local repository to GitHub:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/financial-ratio-calculator.git
git push -u origin main
```

Now your code is on GitHub! You can share the link with colleagues, collaborate on improvements, and track issues.

### Pull Requests: The Professional Way to Collaborate

When working with a team of financial analysts, direct changes to the main codebase can be risky. Pull requests (PRs) provide a mechanism for review and discussion before code is merged:

1. Make your changes in a separate branch
2. Push that branch to GitHub
3. Open a PR to merge your branch into main
4. Have teammates review your code
5. Merge the PR once approved

This workflow is perfect for finance teams where code accuracy is critical; catching calculation errors before they make it into production reports!

## Writing Clean, PEP 8 Compliant Code

### What is PEP 8?

PEP 8 is Python's style guideâ€”a set of conventions for writing readable code. In finance, where you might be sharing models with auditors or other stakeholders, clean code is particularly important.

### Key PEP 8 Rules for Finance Code

- **Use 4 spaces for indentation** (not tabs)
- **Keep lines under 79 characters** for better readability in documentation
- **Use descriptive variable names** that reflect financial concepts:

```python
# Bad
def calc(a, b):
    return a / b

# Good
def calculate_price_to_earnings_ratio(stock_price, earnings_per_share):
    return stock_price / earnings_per_share
```

- **Use whitespace appropriately**:

```python
# Bad
profit=revenue-expenses
tax_amount=profit*tax_rate

# Good
profit = revenue - expenses
tax_amount = profit * tax_rate
```

### Using Linters: flake8

Linters automatically check your code for style issues. Let's set up flake8:

1. Install flake8:

```bash
pip install flake8
```

2. Run flake8 on your code:

```bash
flake8 ratio_calculator.py
```

It will show any style violations that need fixing.

3. For a real finance project, create a configuration file (`.flake8`) in your project root:

```
[flake8]
max-line-length = 88
exclude = .git,__pycache__,build,dist
per-file-ignores =
    __init__.py: F401
```

### Auto-formatting with black

Why spend time manually formatting code when tools can do it for you?

1. Install black:

```bash
pip install black
```

2. Format your code:

```bash
black ratio_calculator.py
```

Black will automatically reformat your code to follow a consistent style.

3. For finance projects, you might want to create a `pyproject.toml` file to configure black:

```toml
[tool.black]
line-length = 88
target-version = ['py38']
include = '\.pyi?$'
exclude = '''
/(
    \.git
  | \.hg
  | \.mypy_cache
  | \.tox
  | \.venv
  | _build
  | buck-out
  | build
  | dist
)/
'''
```

### Organising Imports with isort

isort automatically organises your import statements by type and alphabetically.

1. Install isort:

```bash
pip install isort
```

2. Run isort on your file:

```bash
isort ratio_calculator.py
```

For finance projects where you might be importing various data analysis libraries, isort keeps your imports clean and consistent:

```python
# Standard library imports
import datetime
import os
from decimal import Decimal

# Third-party imports
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

# Local application imports
from .financial_models import discounted_cash_flow
from .ratio_analysis import calculate_current_ratio
```

## Writing Effective Documentation

### Docstrings: Your Future Self Will Thank You

Documentation isn't just for others, it's useful for you six months from now when you can't remember why you wrote that complex financial calculation a certain way.

#### Google Style Docstrings

```python
def calculate_npv(cash_flows, discount_rate):
    """
    Calculate Net Present Value of a series of cash flows.
    
    Args:
        cash_flows (list): List of cash flows, where the first element is the initial investment (negative)
        discount_rate (float): Annual discount rate as a decimal (e.g., 0.1 for 10%)
        
    Returns:
        float: Net Present Value
        
    Examples:
        >>> calculate_npv([-1000, 200, 300, 400, 500], 0.1)
        152.07
    """
    npv = cash_flows[0]  # Initial investment
    for i, cf in enumerate(cash_flows[1:], 1):
        npv += cf / (1 + discount_rate) ** i
    return round(npv, 2)
```

#### NumPy Style Docstrings

```python
def calculate_irr(cash_flows):
    """
    Calculate Internal Rate of Return for a series of cash flows.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    cash_flows : list or array-like
        List of cash flows, where the first element is the initial investment (negative)
    
    Returns
    -------
    float
        The Internal Rate of Return as a decimal
    
    Notes
    -----
    Uses Newton's method to find the rate that makes NPV = 0
    
    Examples
    --------
    >>> calculate_irr([-1000, 300, 400, 500])
    0.1548
    """
    # IRR implementation...
```

Choose one style and be consistent across your project.

### Generating Documentation with Sphinx

For larger finance projects, automatic documentation generation with Sphinx is invaluable:

1. Install Sphinx:

```bash
pip install sphinx sphinx-rtd-theme
```

2. Set up a docs directory:

```bash
mkdir docs
cd docs
sphinx-quickstart
```

3. Configure `conf.py` to use a nice theme:

```python
html_theme = 'sphinx_rtd_theme'
```

4. Build your documentation:

```bash
sphinx-build -b html . _build
```

This creates HTML documentation you can share with your finance team.

4. **Validate with linters and formatters**:
   - Run black to format code
   - Run isort to organise imports
   - Run flake8 to check for issues

5. **Create tests** (more on this in the next post)

6. **Push to GitHub and collaborate**:
   - Share with colleagues
   - Use pull requests for reviews
   - Track issues and feature requests
