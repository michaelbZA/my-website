## My Python Learning Journey

Welcome to my Python learning series! As a finance professional exploring programming, I'm documenting my entire journey through 17 posts that take you from absolute beginner to building practical applications.

## What to Expect from This Series

This series is designed for fellow finance professionals and beginners who want to learn Python in a practical, step-by-step manner. Each post builds on previous concepts while introducing new skills.

## Series Overview

Here's what we'll cover throughout the 17 posts:

## Foundations (Posts 1–6)

### 1. Getting Started with Python on Windows
- What is Python, why learn it, and where it's used
- Installing Python (step‑by‑step Windows installer with screenshots)
- Quick pointers for macOS/Linux installs
- Your first "Hello, World!" script
- Exploring the interactive REPL (shell)

### 2. Text Editors vs. IDEs for Python Development
- Lightweight editors (Notepad++, Sublime) vs. full IDEs (VS Code, PyCharm)
- Setting up VS Code for Python (extensions, linting, auto‑format)
- Code highlighting, IntelliSense/autocomplete, and snippets
- Running and debugging code from your editor
- Quick intro to IDE‑based breakpoints vs. print‑driven debugging

### 3. Python Syntax Fundamentals & Language Features
- Variables, data types (numbers, strings, booleans) and operators
- Indentation and control flow (if/elif/else, loops)
- Comprehensions & lambdas: list/dict/set comprehensions, map/filter, anonymous functions
- Iterators & generators: the iterator protocol, writing your own with yield
- Basic error handling: try/except, else/finally

### 4. Core Data Structures
- Lists: creation, indexing, slicing, methods
- Tuples: immutability, packing/unpacking
- Dictionaries: key–value access, common methods
- Sets: uniqueness, union/intersection/difference
- Choosing the right structure for the task

### 5. Functions, Modules & File I/O
- Defining and calling functions (def, return, positional vs. keyword args)
- Variable scope and namespaces
- Organizing code into modules and packages
- Exploring the Standard Library (math, random, datetime, os, sys)
- Reading from/writing to text files with open() and the with statement

### 6. Virtual Environments & Packaging
- Why virtual environments matter (avoiding dependency conflicts)
- Creating/activating/deactivating venv on Windows (and notes for macOS/Linux)
- Managing packages with pip: install, freeze, requirements.txt
- Basic packaging: project structure, setup.py/pyproject.toml essentials
- Publishing to PyPI with twine and versioning best practices

---

## Professional Best Practices (Posts 7–9)

### 7. Code Quality & Collaboration
- Version control fundamentals with Git & GitHub (clone, commit, push, pull requests)
- Writing clean, PEP 8‑compliant code; linting with flake8
- Auto‑formatting with black and organizing imports with isort
- Writing docstrings (Google vs. NumPy style) and auto‑generating docs (Sphinx overview)

### 8. Testing & Debugging
- Unit testing basics with unittest and pytest (assertions, test discovery)
- Fixtures in pytest and intro to TDD workflows
- Raising and defining custom exceptions (raise, subclassing Exception)
- Using the debugger: pdb commands and IDE‑based breakpoints
- Structured logging with the logging module (levels, handlers, formatting)

### 9. Command‑Line Tools & Automation
- Building CLI scripts with argparse: positional args, flags, help text
- Packaging entry points (console_scripts) for installable commands
- Automating file/folder tasks (os, shutil): renaming, organizing, backups
- Automating GUI interactions with PyAutoGUI (keyboard/mouse control)
- Putting it all together in a sample automation project

## Core Tools & Data (Posts 10–13)

### 10. The Python Ecosystem & Interactive Data Workflows
- Clarify package vs. environment managers: pip vs. conda vs. Anaconda
- When and why to choose each (lightweight vs. data‑science bundles)
- Installing and exploring Anaconda Navigator
- Jupyter Notebooks: installing via pip/Anaconda, notebook anatomy (code vs. Markdown), basic plots inline

### 11. NumPy Fundamentals for Numerical Data
- Installing NumPy
- The ndarray: creation, indexing, slicing
- Vectorized operations and broadcasting rules
- Performance comparison vs. pure Python lists

### 12. Data Analysis with pandas
- Installing pandas
- Understanding Series and DataFrame objects
- Reading data (CSV, Excel), inspecting and summarising
- Selection, filtering, grouping, transformation
- Handling missing data

### 13. Data Visualization Basics
- Matplotlib core: line, scatter, bar, histogram plots
- Customizing labels, titles, legends
- Seaborn intro: statistical plot types (boxplot, heatmap)
- Saving figures to files for reports

---

## Intermediate Applications (Posts 14–17)

### 14. Introduction to Object‑Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes vs. objects, attributes vs. methods
- The init constructor and self
- Encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism (simple examples)
- Why OOP matters: organizing and reusing code

### 15. Web Development Foundations
- Option A: Flask (lightweight): setting up, routes, templates, serving static files
- Option B: Django (full‑featured): project/app structure, admin interface, ORM intro
- Option C: Web Scraping: requests + BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing
- Deploying your first minimal web app on a free hosting platform (e.g., Heroku)

### 16. Building Simple GUI Applications with Tkinter
- Installing/importing Tkinter (built‑in)
- Creating windows, labels, buttons, entry widgets
- Layout managers (pack, grid)
- A hands‑on mini‑project: e.g., basic calculator or temperature converter

### 17. Next Steps & Advanced Topics
- Concurrency & async: when to use threads vs. processes (threading, multiprocessing), intro to asyncio
- End‑to‑end mini‑project ideas (combine web, data, GUI, testing)
- Recommended books, courses, blogs, and community resources
- Tips for staying sharp: code challenges, open‑source contribution, local meetups
