# PowerShell Essentials: A Comprehensive Guide

## Introduction to Command Line Interfaces

Before diving into PowerShell specifically, it's important to understand what command-line interfaces are and why they remain essential tools for modern computing.

### What is Command Prompt?

Command Prompt (cmd.exe) is the traditional command-line interpreter for Windows operating systems. Dating back to MS-DOS, it allows users to interact with their computer by typing text commands rather than using a graphical user interface (GUI). While functional, Command Prompt has significant limitations:

- Limited scripting capabilities
- Inconsistent command syntax
- Text-only output format
- Limited access to Windows system components

### Why Use a Terminal?

You might wonder why, in an age of sophisticated graphical interfaces, command-line terminals remain relevant. Here's why terminals continue to be indispensable tools:

1. **Efficiency**: Experienced users can execute complex operations faster than using GUI equivalents
2. **Automation**: Commands can be scripted to automate repetitive tasks
3. **Remote administration**: Servers and remote systems are often managed via command line
4. **Resource efficiency**: Terminal operations typically use fewer system resources
5. **Precision**: Commands provide explicit control over system operations
6. **Reproducibility**: Command sequences can be saved, shared, and executed consistently

## Enter PowerShell: The Modern Command Line

PowerShell represents Microsoft's evolution of the command-line interface, designed to address the limitations of Command Prompt while providing a powerful environment for both casual users and system administrators.

### Why PowerShell is Superior to Command Prompt

PowerShell offers a number of advantages over traditional Command Prompt:

- **Object-based pipeline**: Commands pass entire objects rather than just text
- **Consistent syntax**: Commands follow a Verb-Noun pattern for intuitive learning
- **Extensive .NET integration**: Direct access to .NET framework capabilities
- **Rich scripting language**: Includes variables, functions, loops, conditions, and error handling
- **Robust module system**: Functionality can be extended through modules
- **Remote management**: Built-in remoting capabilities for managing distant systems
- **Backward compatibility**: Can still run most traditional cmd commands

PowerShell has become Microsoft's preferred command-line shell and scripting language, making it an essential skill for Windows administration and automation.

## Getting Started with PowerShell

### Opening PowerShell

You can access PowerShell in several ways:
- Search for "PowerShell" in the Windows start menu
- Right-click the Start button and select "Windows PowerShell"
- Press Win+X and select "Windows PowerShell"
- For the latest version, install "PowerShell 7" from the Microsoft Store or GitHub

### Understanding the PowerShell Interface

When you open PowerShell, you'll see a blue console window with a prompt that looks something like:

```
PS C:\Users\YourUsername>
```

The "PS" prefix indicates you're in PowerShell, followed by your current directory location.

## Essential PowerShell Concepts

### Cmdlets: PowerShell Commands

PowerShell commands are called "cmdlets" (pronounced "command-lets") and follow a consistent Verb-Noun naming convention:

- `Get-Process`: Lists running processes
- `Stop-Service`: Stops a Windows service
- `New-Item`: Creates a new file or directory

This standardised naming makes discovering and learning commands more intuitive.

### Pipeline: Chaining Commands

One of PowerShell's most powerful features is the pipeline operator `|`, which passes the output of one command as input to another:

```powershell
Get-Process | Sort-Object -Property CPU -Descending | Select-Object -First 5
```

This command gets all processes, sorts them by CPU usage, and displays only the top 5.

### Variables

Variables in PowerShell start with `$`:

```powershell
$name = "John"
$age = 30
Write-Output "Hello, $name! You are $age years old."
```

## Essential PowerShell Commands

### Navigation and File System

#### Getting and Changing Location

```powershell
# Display current directory
Get-Location
# Alias: pwd

# Change directory
Set-Location C:\Windows
# Aliases: cd, chdir
```

#### Listing Directory Contents

```powershell
# List items in current directory
Get-ChildItem
# Aliases: ls, dir

# List with details
Get-ChildItem -Force

# Filter by extension
Get-ChildItem -Filter *.txt
```

#### Working with Files and Directories

```powershell
# Create a new directory
New-Item -Path "C:\temp\NewFolder" -ItemType Directory

# Create a new file
New-Item -Path "C:\temp\test.txt" -ItemType File

# Copy a file
Copy-Item "C:\temp\test.txt" -Destination "C:\temp\test_backup.txt"

# Move a file
Move-Item "C:\temp\test.txt" -Destination "C:\temp\NewFolder\test.txt"

# Delete a file
Remove-Item "C:\temp\test_backup.txt"

# Read file content
Get-Content "C:\temp\NewFolder\test.txt"
```

#### Navigating the File System (Useful Aliases)

Below are a few useful aliases that I use to navigate the file system

| Command/Alias | Full Command | Description | Example |
|---------------|--------------|-------------|---------|
| `ls` | `Get-ChildItem` | Lists files and directories | `ls` or `ls -Force` (to show hidden items) |
| `cd` | `Set-Location` | Changes directory | `cd C:\Users` or `cd ~` (home directory) |
| `pwd` | `Get-Location` | Shows current directory path | `pwd` |
| `mkdir` | `New-Item -ItemType Directory` | Creates a new directory | `mkdir NewFolder` |
| `pushd` | `Push-Location` | Saves current location and moves to new location | `pushd C:\Temp` |
| `popd` | `Pop-Location` | Returns to previously saved location | `popd` |
| `cat` | `Get-Content` | Displays file contents | `cat file.txt` |
| `touch` | `New-Item` | Creates a new file | `touch newfile.txt` |
| `rm` | `Remove-Item` | Deletes files or directories | `rm file.txt` or `rm -Recurse folder` |
| `cp` | `Copy-Item` | Copies files | `cp file.txt destination` |
| `mv` | `Move-Item` | Moves or renames files | `mv file.txt newname.txt` |

### System Information and Management

#### Process Management

```powershell
# List all running processes
Get-Process

# Find specific processes
Get-Process -Name "chrome"

# Stop a process
Stop-Process -Name "notepad"
# Or by ID
Stop-Process -Id 1234
```

#### Service Management

```powershell
# List all services
Get-Service

# Get specific service
Get-Service -Name "wuauserv"  # Windows Update service

# Start a service
Start-Service -Name "wuauserv"

# Stop a service
Stop-Service -Name "wuauserv"
```

#### System Information

```powershell
# Basic system info
Get-ComputerInfo

# Operating system details
Get-CimInstance Win32_OperatingSystem

# Hardware information
Get-CimInstance Win32_ComputerSystem

# Disk information
Get-PSDrive
```

### Networking Commands

```powershell
# Test network connection
Test-NetConnection google.com

# Ping a host
Test-Connection google.com

# Get IP configuration
Get-NetIPConfiguration

# Get DNS client server addresses
Get-DnsClientServerAddress
```

### User and Security

```powershell
# Get current user
$env:USERNAME

# Get all local users
Get-LocalUser

# Create a new local user
New-LocalUser -Name "NewUser" -Description "New user account" -NoPassword

# Get user groups
Get-LocalGroup
```

## Working with PowerShell Help

PowerShell includes a comprehensive help system:

```powershell
# Get help on a cmdlet
Get-Help Get-Process

# Get detailed help with examples
Get-Help Get-Process -Detailed
Get-Help Get-Process -Examples

# Update help files
Update-Help
```

## PowerShell Scripting Basics

### Script Execution Policy

By default, PowerShell restricts running scripts. To check your current policy:

```powershell
Get-ExecutionPolicy
```

To change it (requires admin rights):

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

Common policies:
- `Restricted`: No scripts can run
- `RemoteSigned`: Local scripts can run; downloaded scripts need signing
- `Unrestricted`: All scripts can run (not recommended)

### Creating a Basic Script

PowerShell scripts use the `.ps1` extension. Create a file named `hello.ps1`:

```powershell
# hello.ps1
param(
    [string]$name = "World"
)

Write-Output "Hello, $name!"
```

Run it:

```powershell
.\hello.ps1
.\hello.ps1 -name "John"
```

### Basic Flow Control

```powershell
# If statement
$age = 18
if ($age -ge 18) {
    Write-Output "Adult"
} else {
    Write-Output "Minor"
}

# Foreach loop
$fruits = @("Apple", "Banana", "Cherry")
foreach ($fruit in $fruits) {
    Write-Output "I like $fruit"
}

# While loop
$i = 1
while ($i -le 5) {
    Write-Output "Count: $i"
    $i++
}
```

## Advanced PowerShell Features

### Working with Objects

PowerShell's object pipeline is powerful. For example, get specific properties:

```powershell
Get-Process | Select-Object -Property Name, CPU, ID | Sort-Object -Property CPU -Descending
```

### Filtering Objects

```powershell
# Filter processes using CPU more than 10
Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.CPU -gt 10 }

# Find large files
Get-ChildItem -Path C:\ -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | 
    Where-Object { $_.Length -gt 1GB }
```

### PowerShell Modules

Modules extend PowerShell's functionality:

```powershell
# List available modules
Get-Module -ListAvailable

# Import a module
Import-Module ActiveDirectory

# Find commands in a module
Get-Command -Module ActiveDirectory
```

### Remote Management

PowerShell can manage remote computers:

```powershell
# Create a remote session
$session = New-PSSession -ComputerName Server01

# Run command on remote computer
Invoke-Command -ComputerName Server01 -ScriptBlock { Get-Process }

# Enter interactive session
Enter-PSSession -ComputerName Server01
```

## PowerShell in Modern Windows Environments
